My room on the fifth floor had two comfortable beds and plenty of space for one person. The TV is a little small by todays standards with a limited number of channels. There was a small bit of mold in the bathtub area that could have been removed with a little bleach. It appeared the carpets were not vacummed every day. I reported a light bulb was burned out. It was never replaced. Ice machines are on the odd numbered floors, but the one on my floor did not work. I encountered some staff in the elevator one evening and I mentioned the ice machine to them.

id10328,"I booked this hotel through Hotwire at the lowest price I could find. When we got there the front desk manager gave us a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""smoking"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" room. I argued that I have a little baby and I would not have booked the room had I known it was smoking. The manager would not hear anything further and told me that Hotwire books the cheapest rooms that are available. So, from the get go I was very unhappy.
After a great deal of persuasion and discussion, I got a nonsmoking room. Thereafter the room had the most minimal amenities. Besides the great location (near Dupont Circle), there was not much to say about this overpriced hotel. The room was small and in OK condition. The bathroom was small with a tub. The bathroom amenities were also minimal. We did not have a fridge or a microwave and had to again rent a fridge from the staff (to keep baby things).
The parking costs $-- per day so it is best not to drive here. Also the breakfast is not included. The lobby is very small and feels old. The only thing available is coffee in the lobby which is decent.
All in all, poor service, minimal amenities, small rooms, small bathrooms, no view, but great location. Some distance from the metro (either McPherson station or Dupont station). Try to look for better if available.",Mozilla,Tablet,not happy

All of us expected a certain level of service since we were staying at the Ritz, however this hotel certainly didn't meet what we would consider Ritz standards.
The rooms were fine. They were clean with well appointed bathrooms, but nothing to get excited about. The service however was awful. The first night we were there, I made -- calls to the bell man, before someone in hotel communications picked up the phone. Then on Saturday night before we left for dinner at -:--, we requested to have extra hotels delivered to our room and our trash removed. When we returned at --:--, neither request was fullfilled. I made another call to housekeeping and then finally things were taken care of. In my opinion, for the rates we were paying, we should have had nightly turn down service.
I did speak with a manager when we checked out and he said he would make it worth our while to return, however all we received was a letter of apology.
Needless to say, we have no plans to return to this hotel. My husband and I stayed at the Four Seasons Boston in February of ---- and had a wonderful stay.

id10338,"We stay at the Jolly Madison over the Xmas period, the main feature is it's location. You are never far from most tourist attractions from this hotel. Grand Central Station is a short walk and gets you to other places you can't get to by walking (cheaper than yellow cabs - although you should also give this a go. We booked a cab with the hotel to take us back to the airport upon our departure and we got a limo - what a way to leave New York! This was certainly better than our inward travel. Got a transfer just outside the airport and spent -- minutes driving between terminals collecting other fares before arriving back at our original terminal and heading off to our hotel.
Our room was on a top floor high which was great as it meant less traffic and street noise. We had some problems with the heater in our room but the reception staff eventually resolved this by providing us with a portable heater.
We did not eat at the hotel at all because diners and deli's are available in close proximity. The best meals we found were in China Town and at Planet Holywood. If you are planning to go to Planet Hollywood negotiate a travel within the main section of the restaurant before being shown to your table otherwise you may end up like us on the top floor overlooking the action and not in it.
We took part in typical tourist activities such as Ripleys and the CSI Experience. Disappointed with both unfortunately. Had hoped to see a broadway play but we left it to late and the only available tickts were $--- each. If you ant to get to the to of the Empire State bilding would suggest going early as the queue by mid-day will take at least an hour. The boat trips around New York are great and the best way to see the Statue of Liberty, The Brooklyn Bridge etc.
Make sure you book the ---- Memorial at reception. Although very emotional it gives you a true understanding of the events which took place and an appreciation for life and the spirit of New Yorkers.
The store window displays, Xmas trees and ice skating rings are just amazing over Xmas. Ice skating on Xmas Eve on Xmas day was definetely a highlight and the Hot Chocolate with marshmallows and whipped cream is wonderful. Do be careful if paying for a padlock for the lockers. I forgot where ours was and soehow managed to gain access to someone elses ;-(
Stumbling across Times Square one evening whilst taking a stroll was enlightening literally. All of a sudden he colour of the sky was bright. There are so many illuminated signs and this area has a real buzz at night time. Didn't care too much for the hoards of people here during the day though.
We did use the hotel bar on our last evening. The bar man was nice and friendly. The bar room was a little odd and resembled a chapel or such like.

-. The carpet in the corridor is not very clean and it smelled weird there. The pool area was no better - actually, much worse. I wouldn't recommend going barefoot anywhere in that area. It's just dirty.
-. The coffee maker in the room was broken - it made --- cup of coffee and then turned off. So if you want a full cup, you have to ask it - times. Of course, by then the cup is almost all cold. Good luck making tea with it, if you don't like ice tea.
-. Once we have used the provided tea packs, room service didn't bother to replace them. Probably saved them a cent or so.
-. There's no free internet access in the business center and no free printing. I am staying in various hotels a lot and wasn't used before to being charged dollar-a-minute for printing a simple page of driving directions. I was used to getting it for free, as it was in most hotels of this class I visited. Hilton, however, decided to save yet another ---- of a cent.
-. Most hotels provide some sort of paper for the guests to write on. Hilton has post-it notes. Literally - tiny squares of paper, and that's it. If you want to write down something that's not - words - good luck, Hilton is not going to help, go find an Office Depot and buy it yourself. Here, another cent saved for Hilton. 
-. Parking pricing is outrageous - I've parked cheaper in San-Francisco downtown, no discounts or anything for hotel guests - but don't expect that to mean easy and convenient parking. Parking lot is crammed, and spending -- minutes looking for a random place somebody didn't notice, or trying to fit your car into the space that nobody dared to use because it's too small - is routine. All while a bunch of spaces stay empty - but general public is not allowed there, probably so that they can charge you ---% for valet parking in the same spot, in addition to the outrageous price paid for the parking - which a lot of hotels of this class provide for free. In Hilton, I not only got charged for it - I got charged twice in one of the days. They can't even make their system work properly.
Summarily, the personnel of the hotel was very nice, welcoming and pleasant. They did what they could. However, the hotel itself fell below the expectations - I paid more than I expected to pay for less than I expected to get from Hilton. I understand the economy is tough and everybody has to save, but saving on a couple of sheets of paper and a couple of tea bags is too much for me. When I go to a brand-name hotel like Hilton I don't expect that. After this stay I would think twice - no, a dozen times - before ever staying at a Hilton establishment again.

This property was a let down. Initially, things went smoothly. Check-in was fine, as a HHonors Gold member I was informed with an apology that they did not have an Executive Floor to upgrade me to, but put me in a - bedroom suite and offered me a complimentary buffet breakfast and the usual wifi vouchers. This is where the good things ended.
The room had issues. Initially, the phone in the living room did not work. They sent someone up to fix the phone, and then some --- hours later it just started randomly producing high pitched beeps (which in turn woke me up). In addition, the guest compendium was empty (as in someone had removed the pages). It took - phone calls and - people to come up to my room to actually understand what I was requesting, and deliver a full compendium.
I also had cause to contact and visit the front desk at various stages later in the evening during my stay. To say the night staff were next to useless would be an over-statement. The night manager basically said nothing to my requests, or as little as possible. They treated me like I was putting them out of their way and disrupting them being lazy. One particular staff member was so bad I wrote a separate complaint to Hilton about them.
I also witnessed a lady in obvious distress attempting to get a room late one evening. When they informed her she was not able to get a room without photo ID she became upset and aggravated.

id10348,"I very much wanted to stay at a boutique hotel near Times Square in lieu of a Hilton or Marriott type. After some research, hubby and I compromised on The Paramount after seeing the price of their modern chic rooms on the website. When we checked in we were both excited about the impressive lobby. Very us. BUT we were royally disappointed when we entered our King Deluxe room. Womp womp womp...
I'm normally a very flexible-laid back, go with the flow gal but this just wasn't what I was expecting at all.
The pictures seemed to be photo shopped bright and welcoming on the website. In reality, the room was entirely too small and the bathroom lacked a lot of luster. The room just seemed so dark and small. Just NOT what we had in mind for our - night NYC experience. The money spent renovating this hotel was obviously poured into the more public areas of the hotel. The closet would better be described as a compartment to store ~- jackets so our suitcases took up the little floor space we had.
We headed downstairs and explained our concerns and requested upgrade options. I inquired about their Entertainment and Couture suites displayed on their website as they are the only ones displayed. Do you know what they told me?! The available suites displayed on their website are only used for corporate events and fashion shoots. I was dumbfounded. I encouraged them to provide keys to the suite that they DO have available for purchase so that I can see it before we accept the upgrade for an additional $--- for our - nights in NYC. We saw it and it was another womp womp womp. They had simply take a wall and corned off - rooms at the end of the hallway. Even the rooms still had the heavy secure hotel door separating the bedroom from the living room AND the exit sign still existed in the cornered off wasted space in the entrance of the suite. The bedroom in the suite had a double bed. My husband and I are very tall and we by no means intend to share a double bed while paying for a suite. Desperately trying to see the positive, I looked out the window to see if our view had been upgraded. View from Times Square? It had been a bit but a partial view of lights from Times Square and the back of a billboard just wasn't worth it to me. Womp womp womp.
We headed back downstairs, handed them the suite key and stated that we will only be spending - night at The Paramount and would be checking out the following day. (Obviously, it was too late to cancel our room that night and not pay a fee, etc.) The customer service was very kind so I hadn’t the heart to share my disappointment. I'm sure it was obvious by our actions at that point.
I've attached a picture of my hubby stretching out his hands so that you get an idea of just how small the King Deluxe room is. Note our luggage covering the entire opposite side of the bed. No point in showing you the view out the window, it was the back of a building.

We arrived at about -:--am after flying in on a red eye.

We went to breakfast and returned at --:-- and were told that our room was still not ready. We waited another ninety minutes and checked back with the front desk and were told that they would put a rush on our room with housekeeping, that they were in the process of cleaning it, and to come back in a half an hour. We did, and the room still wasn't ready. By that time we were both exhausted and perhaps the front desk person took pity on us and upgraded us to a junior suite. 
The room was quite large especially for New York hotel rooms. We had views of the street from two sides, which we enjoyed, but it was noisy. It didn't bother us, but I think it would wake up a light sleeper. The bed was comfortable and the reading lights had dimmers. The desk was large and had a power strip.
We chose this hotel over the other InterContinental in New York City because of the price, location, and previous reviewer's glowing comments. There were a few little details that just didn't compare with previous experience we've had with this hotel brand.
The furniture looked a bit shabby with scuff marks on the table and tired looking furniture, chipped paint. The bathroom had a light fixture hanging loosely from the ceiling. There was some mold on the ceiling in the shower area. There were a couple of times that I had to wait over five minutes for hot water in the bathroom and the bathroom sink had a constant drip. One of our towels had a large hole in it.

Check-in was smooth and fast, and the staff were courteous and knowledgeable. The lobby is nicely decorated in a contemporary style, but the building sure shows its age once one heads up to the guestroom floors. The woodwork outside our room was so battered looked as if someone had been hacking at it with an ax. 
On the positive side, I liked the overal design of the room, and the bedding was of nice quality. But there were some serious flaws. The bathroom cabinet was cracked so severely that some of the wood veneer had copletely fallen off. And, although I asked for a nonsmoking room, the place smelled strongly of smoke. We are not smokers and didn't spend any time with smokers during our trip, but our clothes absorbed the smell from the room. When we got home and unzipped our suitcases, the smell of smoke was extremely strong. I had to dryclean the brand new overcoat that I had just purchased that very weekend at Saks.
Other positives about this hotel are the location. It was very convienient to Magnificent Mile shopping and attractions. The cafe attached served great coffee, and I never waited more than a couple of minutes for my order. And, again, the staff were helpful and pleasant.

The location of the hotel was convenient, as it was near the National Mall and government offices but also within - mile of several other points of interest. I based value on the overall perks-to-cost ratio. It's not scientific, but based on the feeling of, """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""did I get a good deal?""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
The first impressiom of the services was upon entering the parking garage. Valet parking is available on-location, but for the steep price of $---day. They may have mentioned that detail on the website, but I still think the Kimpton management could negotiate a better contract or reduce the overhead fee. Parking for one night added an extra --% to my overall cost. The lobby is crisp and decorated in modern style-color scheme with unique lucite bubble chairs. The decor didn't have much of an effect on my mood, since the mod furniture and walls were predominately upholstered in aubergine and burgundy shades of vinyl. I guess it just wasn't my taste, though the eye catching details could be perceived as young and fresh.
Upon check-in at -:-- pm, the friendly receptionist informed me that my room was not ready due to cleaning (?!) but that I could be upgraded to a suite.

On the --th floor, my spacious suite greeted me with the stale smell of cigarette smoke-as though it had formerly been a smoking room (though Kimpton properties are smoke-free as the room placard informed me, this hotel recently changed management). The area rug that overlayed the carpeting was askew. This wasnt necessarily a sign of uncleanliness but probably that nobody checked the room before my arrival.

After a quiet and comfortable night's rest, I took advantage of the complimentary coffee bar in the lobby. The brew was exceptional-was encouraged to take a second cup to-go, as well as a bottle of water. Detail-oriented hospitality was top-notch, and I have no doubt that the staff would go out of their way to assist any guest.

Oddly, about - floors' worth of the soda machines didn't work. We reported it to the front desk.
The parking situation was weird, since it doesn't belong to the hotel, I think. Hotel guests park on floors four through seven of the garage off to the side, but it seems to be event parking as well. We had to stalk parking spots, since it was really crowded, and some jerks in giant cars took up more than one parking spot. We could have done the valet parking, but the self-park was a great deal ($--, I think).
The workout center was in need of more ventilation (older building - window a-c units), and it is a little small, but they have what you need: cardio machines, free weights and a bench, and a multi-station weight machine.

Another bad thing about the hotel is the fact that you can hear almost everything that is going on next door! And I mean EVERYTHING! You hear when people get up, go to the bathroom, whisper!! One night I was even fricked out because I thought someone was trying to come in to my room, although in reality my neighbour attempted to come in next door.
I didn’t try breakfast which was not included in the room price, but there’s a Starbucks just in the same building – no problem with that.
All and all, I wouldn’t recommend the hotel, although it is a pity, because the stuff is really trying their best and the location is very convenient.",Edge,Tablet,not happy

id10423,"My stay at the W City Center was a Dr. Jekyll- Mr. Hyde type ordeal. For every task that they did well, there was an equal and opposite task that flopped. 
As a former frequent traveler I have stayed in many different hotels ranging from - stars to - stars. And, lately, I have been having good, solid experiences booking - star hotels for my leisure trips through priceline, but my stay at the W City Center in Chicago ended that string of luck.I had read many other reviews on this website before my trip and I felt like I had enough information to know what to expect, but I was wrong.
I rated my experience at the W a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""-,"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" but it was closer to a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""-.--"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" and just like in math class, I rounded down. I am not sure what the exact criteria is for star ratings, but for service, the W City Centre is a solid """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""-.-,"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" but that's as good as it gets.
My flight landed at Midway at about -:-- am, so I took the Orange line and arrived at the hotel at around --:-- am. I was expecting to check my luggage, but to my surprise I was able to check-in. And, according to them, they upgraded my bed from full to queen and gave me a courtyard view on the --th floor, so that noise from the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""L"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" wouldn't bother me. What a joke!!! 
My bed wasn't even a full, it was more like a double... maybe even a twin-and-a-half. My wife and I, who sleep in a King at home, were practically on top of each other. And the courtyard view, looked more like the view from a project in Brooklyn. And, I understand that the interior rooms in the hotel have no choice but to have a view like that, but please don't tell me it's an upgrade, when it really isn't. I would have rather heard the train and had a view of the outside world, than to feel like I was in prison.
The room was tiny! After I learned was staying at the W, I looked it up and saw that the rooms were small, but the website doesn't do the room justice. There was exactly enough room to turn around, but that was about it. there was a lounge chair in the corner that was unecessary in that size room and the desk where one could use a laptop was at the foot of the bed. When you pulled the chair out to take a seat, it hit the foot of the bed, so you had to squeeze into the space between the desk and the chair. At -'-"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""", --- lbs, I'm not a huge man, but it was a feat for me to do that.
The television was in a cabinet to the left of the bed, so I had to turn my head at an awkward angle to view it. And, the question that kept running through my mind was, """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""If this is a - star hotel, where is the plasma TV?"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" I have stayed at many other - star hotels in Chicago that have had plasma for years and if I remember correctly the W Lakeshore has plasma TV's in it's rooms. 
I liked the fact that there was a safe in the room for my valuables, it made me feel much more comfortable about leaving certain things in the room. But, it was a too small for my laptop.
The bathroom was also very tiny, but it had a full-sized tub and a fantastic shower head. Also, the little Bliss sample products were great so I purchased full-sized versions. The toilet was extremely noisy, but I believe I figured out why. The flush was a little longer and stronger than a usual toilet, but I think it was so that all """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""debris"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" could be cleaned with one flush instead of possibly flushing more than once. I mean it's so loud, the flushing next door would wake my wife in the middle of the night.
The service at the door was great, but it came in spurts. At one point there might be three gentlemen opening the door, but at others there might not be any, only the person that hails cabs for you and if your hands are full and he's busy, then you're stuck! I didn't see a handicapped button you can push to open it automatically.
The location is decent. You're very close to the Orange and Brown line trains, two blocks from the Blue line and - or - blocks from the Red line. And, unless you're going out at midnight, like we did, there is usually a cab in the vicinity.
Overall, this is not a - star hotel. You either have great service or none at all and I didn't appreciate being misled to think I was receiving some sort of benefit. I decided not to patronize the restaurant (Shikago) or bar (Whiskey Blue) because there are many other places in Chicago I'd rather spend my money. Please do your research.

That said, it's still a cheap hotel. And in my case, a smelly one. Perhaps it was just this room, though I doubt it. The elevator area had a chokingly bad smell as well. The smell that permeated the entire studio suite was foul. Foul to the point of keeping me up most of the night. Foul to the point of burying my head in the (comfy) pillows to suffocate myself. Foul to the point of leaving my clothes with a stench of, I don't know, a combination of paint, cleaning fluid and old war bandage that needs to be changed. I opened the window to the -- degree winter, but even that didn't clear the air. Really really unfortunate. 
They did put my able self in a handicap room when I checked in after midnight, so maybe I just got the leftover room that nobody actually wanted. I don't know.

This time we decided to book a corner room because from seeing photos, they have a better layout and far better kitchen-area seating. Plus you have more windows. We ended up in one on the --th floor with a view up -th Avenue where you could see the beginning of Central Park. Plus, we had a partial view of the Chrysler Building.
I'll start with what is good about this hotel. First of all, the front desk staff is very efficient, helpful and friendly. The free breakfast is quite adequate---decent food if nothing to write home about. Also, the maids who cleaned our room during the course of the week did a great job. It also appears that the bed sheets have improved---they are a much higher thread count than what was there previously.
So...how is it slipping? The furniture is starting to get shabby. The hotel is only - years old but hotel furnishings seem to take a real beating.

However, when it's a time of day when most people are out, it's really inexcusable. Speaking of the plumbing---the toilet often had to be flushed twice---not good!
We never experienced these issues during our last stay two years ago. What's up with that? Is the hotel cutting corners when it comes to properly laundering the towels? Are the plumbing problems being worked on?

So far so good but the building has an immense problem with noise exposure. The rooms are extrem clairaudient.

There are a lot of people in the street the whole night, there's always heavy traffic and hooting seems to be mandatory while driving on Bostons roads. There must be also a hospital in the area, expect to hear ambulances with sirens all night long.

Here's a idea, bathrooms are a tool for your stay they need to provide a function and when it's over designed for visual appeal it looses the function.

id10537,"We have stayed in the Charlotte area a number of times but never before at the Marriott City Center. The location suited our needs perfectly for this particular trip.
 The check-in and bellman staff was exceptionally courteous and quite efficient. The lobby was attractive and well-maintained. Self-parking in the garage is not difficult once you navigate the very sharp and narrow curve in the entrance ramp. It felt reasonably safe and well lit. Our room was a bit small but certainly clean and comfortable and very reasonably priced given our discount (AAA, AARP, and Marriott- sponsored packages all work out to pretty much the same weekend discount). 
BUT, and here is why I only rate our stay neutral and consider even that somewhat generous:
We were there on Friday and Saturday nights. Friday night we were awakened by extremely loud voices and laughter in the hallway right outside our room on an upper floor. I peeked out the security peephole and saw a group of well-dressed young people. they were calling to each other from doorway to doorway, down the hall, and generally behaving as though they were in a college dorm on a weekend night. I assume we were the unfortunate hallmates of people who had attended a very successful rehearsal dinner or other youth-oriented event where a lot of alcohol had been consumed and the reality of being in a grownup setting had been forgotten. I called the desk to complain and after five minutes the noise subsided somewhat, whether because the celebrants realized their behavior was unacceptable or because someone came up from the desk to tell them to be quiet I do not know.
Saturday night was much worse and something the hotel should have controlled. The relatively unobtrusive thumping music we had heard and ignored in the background Friday night had become a major annoyance, blasting up to our high-floor room for hours. We tried to go to sleep about --:--; it continued until after - a.m. Several times between - a.m. and - a.m. I called the desk and was told various things, among them that there had once been a club nearby that caused noise problems and the problem had just reappeared.... they were sending someone across the street to complain to the club...not clear if they were calling police, Not quite clear how many other people if any had called to complain this particular night, It was as loud as if we were on the street right outside the club--but keep in mind that not only were we on a high floor, we had our windows closed, and the air conditioning was on. 
I suppose that on a week night for business travelers the Marriott Ceity Center is still a viable option, but I don't know the club habits of Charlotte--perhaps even on a week night there might be an issue. Unless I were to be told with certainty that the club noise was no longer an issue I would not stay at this Marriott again despite its excellent location. I am also disappointed that although my husband included a comment about the excessive noise and poor response from staff in his response to the standard """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""how was your visit"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" survey he received upon our return home, we have received no reply or acknowledgment of any kind--nearly a month after the survey was returned.",Edge,Tablet,not happy

Room: The room was facing the garden, basically it faced a palm tree but it was ok, it provided good shade and kept the place cooler. All amenities were available in the room. Bathroom was ok. But we had to move some furniture (my little one tends to fall from the bed so we always need to create some barriers around his side of the bed) and we noticed that behind furniture the vacuum cleaner had not been used in quite a while. Daily cleaning was done, but from time to time you have to dust behind the beds too!! That took some points off. Also rooms start being worn out a bit, although this is not a big issue in my opinion.

Service at the Grand Hyatt was friendly, provided the staff weren't overwhelmed by crowds. They did automatically offer and accommodate a late checkout, a positive that seems to have become a trend with the chain for loyalty club members. The lobby was generally very busy and loud but not laid out or furnished in a manner to encourage people-watching. The hotel location is great if attending a convention and still pretty good for any other downtown or riverwalk activities with a few blocks of walking. The staff of the main restaurant were too flustered to acknowledge my presence at the time I tried to visit so I gave up and thus can't review the food. 
My room on the --th floor had a nice view but the furniture was a bit worn and about average for a business hotel and below average for a Hyatt though the style fit the Hyatt brand.

Granted the location is not bad, and is close to my business conference, but the rooms are in terrible condition. The bathroom is gross!!! It looks like a -- year old bathroom with cracks everywhere, and a very small tub-shower. The jacuzzi was dirty and seemed like it wasn't cleaned for months. The hotel staff was not very helpful when I asked for directions and told them about the condition of their rooms. They pretty much didn't care.
I read the reviews and thought for a while if whether I should believe the good ones or the bad ones, but I regret believing the good ones. I should've gone with the few reviews below me that spoke the truth about this hotel.

id10595,"Travelled from UK and arrived at Holiday Inn about -.-- in the evening. Check-in was fairly quick but desk staff were rather abrupt. The room itself was clean and tidy however as the room was located near the junction of two roads and two sets of traffic lights the lack of soundproofing was apparent when we entered the room, we believed however that the traffic noise may ease as the evening drew on - WRONG...My family and I were not able to get any sleep due to the constant road noise which rather than getting better later as we had anticipated just got worse - we could hear car radios as they sat at the junction amongst other general traffic noise and road cleaning etc. Quite clearly the soundproofing to the room is inadequate and not the sort of night anyone who has travelled the distance we had wants on their first night in the US.
The next morning my husband complained about the noise and the receptionist said she could move us to another room. We moved to the other room in the morning and then went out as we had travel plans for that day. Upon returning to the room we could hear noise once again - can you believe it we had been put over what I can only imagine was the air conditioning generator or similar, there was a constant noise all night long....how glad were we that we did not have to spend another night here.
Whilst the hotel was clean and tidy and the rooms were adequate we felt very upset that we had been treated so badly. After complaining about the noise on the first night we thought that the staff would have tried at least to give us a room with no noise or even an upgrade but no they did the complete opposite and put us back in the same position.
I would not recommend this hotel for the above reasons and whilst the location to Fishermans Wharf is handy a good nights sleep is more preferable I am sure to anyone.

id10609,"e and a close friend stayed at the hotel recently over the weekend of June --,----. After a long a trip from central california up to the bay area, I went up to the front desk and wanted into to check into my room. As I arrived to the front desk, a hotel associated asked me some questions. She asked me for my credit card on file. I currently have a mastercard debit card that used to book the room. She then, swiped the card, and asked me, """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""how much do you have on here?"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" I told her, less than -- dollars. I wasn't sure why she was asking me this. So now, all of the sudden she tells me that the hotel charges --- dollars a NIGHT for any incidental fees. (I booked the room for two nights) I was completely blow away with that statement. I had already booked the room WELL IN ADVANCE (Back in MARCH in be precise) and i didn't have any spending extra spending money on my card.
I told the hotel associate that """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" I was completely unaware of that, I thought that booking in advance was enough"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" She then NEGOTIATE some sort of """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""plea bargain"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". She stated that because I had booked the room in advance, she would only charge me --- dollars and not --- dollars for the incidental fees.
Told her """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" Let me make some phone calls, and i'll come back up to the front desk."""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" The hotel associate insisted that one of the other associates hold my bags for me. So I gave her my bags.
After making some phone calls, I went back up to the front desk, and the associate that previously helped went on """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""break"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". I was persistent that I needed to speak with her again. One of the lobby attendants went outside to locate her. He came back and told me """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" the next associate will be happy to help you. """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
So I went up to the desk again, and explained my situation. as I was explaining this; the new associate looked at me will a puzzled look. She then stated """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" the incidental fee, is a one time set fee of --- dollars. you don't pay that fee per night, that you stay here"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" so then she swiped my card, and she gave me my room key. I was so happy that I had finally got my room key, for a room that I had paid for well in ADVANCE. My friend was even calling around for other hotels just to see if anything was available; and being that it was PRIDE weekend, no other room were available.
You may think this is the end of my story but it's not.
I was so tired and exhausted for STRESSING about my getting room, that I had forgotten to retrieve my bags. So I went back to the front and asked for my bags. *SIGH* A lobby attendance approached me, and I told him """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" oh I need to get my bags"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" He then asked """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" do you have a baggage claim ticket.""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""oh, so you need to speak to a manager"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" He stated.
After a few minutes he walked out with my bags. FINALLY. and then he asked """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""would you like me to take them to your room?"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" I told him """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""sure"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" I was fed up with the hotel and staff by now.

The rooms are laid out differently - the bed is in the middle of the room and tv is on the exterior wall. I thought that was a pretty cool idea because in some hotels, you can hear the other rooms tv or the bed against the wall... 
The only downside I would say is that some of the finishes appeared cheap. The thread count on the sheets are very low. For me personally, the lowest I'd ever go is ---. These seemed like ---. Also, the finish on the walls is like a fabric and for me, that's not cool - I am allergic to dust mites and fabric is a great hiding place for dust mites.

Our air conditioner struggled to cool the room (and it wasn't even full-on Florida heat outside) and we woke up to the feeling of dew everywhere in the morning. A major purpose of AC in Florida is to pull the moisture out of the air. The front grill of the AC kept falling open, too.

I purchased a club level room, which is on the --st or --nd floor of the tower buliding and you get a lot of perks with that as well. 
When I arrived I had to wait over - hours for my room becuase the person that was staying in my assigned room had not bothered to check out yet. They offered me a room on a lower level but I would still get the club benefits but I decided to wait for the room I paid for not some lower level replacement. The staff also told me that a different club level room was available and that it would be -- minutes so that the staff could clean it so I took this option. An hour later I approached the desk for the third time and was given room keys and sent on my way. 
The club room on the --nd floor is nice but is not all that exciting to be honest, it has great views and has complimentary snacks and drinks as well as breakfast and dinner snacks but not enough nor quality enough to warrant what I paid to stay there.
About the thrid day into my vacation I decided to go and see what the breakfast in the club room had and arrived in time to see dirty plates everywhere and to find out that I was too late. After inquiring more information from the staff member that was up there I learned that upon check in I should have been given a welcome letter explaing all of this and vouchers for the restaraunt in the lobby as well. I went down to the front desk and explained my grief about not being informed.

average staff members
below acceptable customer service
the rooms were good only becuase of the view (the rooms also had extremely firm mattresses that I was unable to sleep on and NO FRIDGE) I had to go and buy a cooler so my leftovers would not go to waste!!!

I spoke with someone named Peaches who was completely unprofessional, unfriendly and rude. I understand it's -am in NY right now but you'd think that they'd have someone decent representing their hotel since that could very well be the first impression.
Anyhow she asked who I wanted to be connected to and when I told her reservations, she said they were closed until -am. Okay, that's understandable. I continue to ask her about the construction - she proceeded to talk to me like """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""I"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" was inconveniencing her and put me on hold without sayiing she was going to gather information. I thought she hung up. She picked up the line and then put me on hold again without saying anything, how do I know? Well because I heard her talking to someone else. 
She said that they would be completely finished with the construction in July and had no additional information to give me.
If this is how the customer service is going to be over the phone - I really don't think I'll be staying there. It's really horrible..I was hoping to try a new hotel.

id10758,"What a beautiful hotel and AWSOME location. Right in the middle of down town San Francisco. Located on Market street, a main road through downtown, this hotel is a very old hotel but has wonderful charm. 
REMEMBER THAT THIS IS PART OF THE LUXURY COLLECTION HOTELS!!
Valet parking is VERY expensive, $-- +tax a day with in and out privledges but we never needed our car. There is NO self parking. The valet guys and the doormen were more that willing to help you with any directions that you need.
The """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""F"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" cable car will take you down to Fisherman's Warf. To pick up the car you cross Market Street to the depot. Cost is $-.-- a person and the ticket you get is usually good for - or so hours so be sure to hold onto it. The only problem with this mode of transportation is that once you get down to the Warf it is really difficult to get back. We waited over -- minutes for a car to come and finally decided to walk back. It's about a - hour walk but very, very enjoyable, just be sure to get a map form the hotel before you venture out. 
There are alot of bums in the area which was a little wierd but I guess that you get that is a big city. They really weren't a problem.
There is a lot just in the hotel area to keep you busy. The genuine cable cars run in the area which was really fun to see. Union Square is a must. Like I said before, be sure to get a street map at the hotel it will REALLY help people that have never been to the area before. 
Now to the hotel itself. Very nice but.........the sheets are AWFUL!! They felt like paper and the bed was old and VERY uncomfortable. When you are staying in a -+ star hotel and may be paying alot of money then why can't EVERYTHING be top of the line?? We are Starwood Gold members and so we were hoping for some sort of an upgrade. When we checked in we went to the preferred check in area and were told that we were given a superior king room. Cool right??? Well, wrong. When we entered the room it was a little small, understandable as to the location of this hotel and space is at a premium in the city. The room and bathroom were nice but cramped. When we looked out the window all that we could see was a part of the hotel. Brick wall with windows of other rooms. We thought if this is what gold and a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""superior"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" room (To get gold status you have to either spend $--,--- or spend -- nights in any SPG property in a years time. Not that easy.) then we wonder what a normal not updated room was like. Don't get me wrong, the room was nice, it had its small problems but it was still nice. 
Room service which we didn't use seemed VERY expensive by looking at the menu. We visited the bar, Maxfield's to have a couple of drinks. We sat at the bar and waited several minutes to get waited on. We finally ordered and they also gave us a bowl of """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""snack"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" type chips. As we were sitting there enjoying ourselves we noticed that when people left they took the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""snack"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" bowls and emptied part of the chips leaving some in and then refilled them....without washing them!!!! OMG!!! We talked to a rude manager and he said that he would take care of it. So BEWARE of Maxfield's and the drinks were VERY expensive around $---- for liquor and $--- a beer. That was the only experience we had with dining. We did notice that the buffet in the morning was around $----- a person. We went to the Starbucks and the McDonalds down the street instead. There is also a Del Taco, Subway, Westfield shopping center and several other stores and restaurants in the area. Also if you are down at the Warf go to Chippino restaurant and eat. VERY GOOD!! 
Just remember that you are smack dab in downtown and this is a great location. Just beware that if you are spending a lot of money that it's not always what you think it is. You also have to remember that you basically need to add $-- a day +TAX to the room for parking. We don't think that we would stay here again as I'm sure that there are other hotels in the area that may be just as good if not better that we would investigate first. Don't be fooled by the name or the look. It was a great experience but not really worth it.

id10759,"My husband and I stayed at the Palmer House for seven nights during the Thanksgiving holiday. Let me point out that Hilton no longer owns the Palmer House - a New York outfit bought it a couple of years ago. They're undergoing a huge $--- million renovation and the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Chicago"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" charm is being killed off in favor of """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""New York-New York!!"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" No offense, but if I want to go to New York City, I'll go. 
I have stayed at the Palmer House dozens of times in the last -- years. The last time prior to this visit was in ----. We decided to give the Palmer House one more try. While the ---- visit certainly lacked lustre, this visit was awful! I remember the graciousness of the hotel. Seeing all the staff happy and better yet, happy to see you! Now - we got the distinct impression we were a bother. The bellmen (and I use the term loosely) look at you when you walk it like you're cramping their style. We saw older guests lugging their cases up the steps, while the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""bellmen"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" yacked on with eachother!! In the entire week we were there, no one opened the door for us - no one greeted us. Shame on these new owners. Don't they know the first thing about customer service? First impressions? Evidently not.
The first room they gave us had a terrible stagnant water smell coming from the bathroom drains. It was horrible and kept us up at night. Furthermore, the carpet had not been vacuumed and the bathroom floor and mirrors were not clean. We had to call housekeeping three times. Each time they would come, they didn't correct the problems! We gave up. We tried to change rooms but were told the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""We're completely sold out..."""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" line. We made our reservations for this trip in July!! We're Hilton Honors members - who cares! Anyway, the next day, we changed rooms and while the room was better, we still experienced problems with water, for instance, on two mornings, the water ran brown with silt! Not good.
The restaurant """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Lockwood"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" did not open until Thanksgiving Day, despite being advertised as opening weeks before. We made reservations there for dinner several weeks prior. I must say, the retaurant is terrible!! The whole layout stinks! The ceilings are far too low, the tables are bare, no table cloths, no flowers, no candles. Stark. The flow of the restaurant is tangled at best. No one knows which way to go while making their way to the buffet, which is situated at the far end of the long and narrow restaurant. It's a zig-zig game getting to and from. Not only that, but we ate there for breakfast each morning (simply because our rate included it) and the congestion at the buffet and lack of service was miserable. There are plenty of waiters hanging about, but I don't think the manager has told them what to do yet!! No salt and pepper shakers and silverware one morning. No coffee the next morning. Funny enough, we spoke to the manager of the restaurant and he admitted to us that the restauarnt had been designed by people who had no restaurant planning experience!! No kidding. I'd avoid this place. To think the hotel closed the wonderful French Quarter Restaurant and opened this??!! Unforgivable!! One more thing about this restaurant. The weird music choice. Who wants to hear Janice Joplin while eating Thanksgiving Dinner - or any other time for that matter!! The music was awful. Rap, New Age, Rock, ect. The manager said they were playing the staff's CD's. Wwhhhhaaat??? 
For a good restaurant, try Petterino's, The South Water Kitchen (WONDERFUL!!) and Harry Caray's. There's also a Corner Bakery that serves good coffee, sandwiches and pastries.
Lastly, the decor is no longer tasteful. The lobby looks awful with a bar sticking out in the middle and massive yellow chairs obstructing the once lovely view. There are people guzzling drinks and half eaten plates of food cluttering up tables - in the lobby!! Dreadful. No relaxation there at all anymore. You cannot even walk through it. It's a circus. The carpet choice on the floors we were on -- and then -- is hideous! I describe at as the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""stone-out peacock of pinball wizardry"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". I have a feeling Potter Palmer would flip if he saw this mess!
What are these new owners thinking??? A staff member told us the new owners also bought the old Carson Pirie Scott building directly across the street, which closed in February. I shutter to think.....
Well, with Marshall Field's selling out to Macy's, Carson's closed the Berghoff Restaurant closed, Trader Vic's closed and now the Palmer House in complete shambles...... Chicago is sinking fast. We sure hate to see it go..... What's next, are they going to raze Wrigley Field now? They seem to be the last man standing. Good-bye Chicago.
We did decide on one thing. No more Hilton Hotels for us. Even though Hilton no longer owns the Palmer House, their name is still attached. We're sticking with Marriott, who is fabulous. (We made the switch after our Palmer House trip three years ago)

I decided I could overlook the intense club-like vibe and overwhelming cologne smell in the lobby... because who doesn't want to stay in a spaceship for a few nights? 
Then came my second visit, two words: bad dream. First of all, a warning: If you value sleep do not stay on the --th floor.

Today, after a long day of meetings I was looking forward to coming up to my room to relax, NOT SO FAST! Guess what? The walls are paper thin! You idiot, you just moved to the fourth floor but you had better pray that your neighbors are quiet and go to bed at a reasonable hour, or that you have the same taste in music. If like me, however, they decided to crank up the techno music and bring the party to their room, count yourself in as their plus one and hang on for a ride into the middle of the night listening to your walls shake as they yell to be heard. 
I should note: I called the front desk and they sent security, this didn't really do much. The biggest issue is honestly the paper thin walls. It is kind of unreal how much you can hear, every word (so if you plan on having sex or private conversations, take note it will be a community experience for your neighbors).
At this point, I am beyond exhausted. I am paying a premium and haven't slept in two days. Being a frequent business traveller to NYC, I love a good deal that is in this neighborhood, but at this rate you couldn't pay me to return to the dream downtown.

If this is the type of etablishment that wins awards these days, then Trip Advisor has a problem.
It was just mediocre- people were nice, breakfast was okay, etc., but nothing to write home about.
The trip started pretty badly as I had Casa arrange an airport pickup. The driver was tremendously unprofessional (a very fat, dirty and smelly version of Danny DeVito) and the car smelled like someone had slept in it for three days.
I complained to the Casa- and they were very understanding and would look into it.
However, if this boutique is all that it is said to be via comments, I would think that they use a first-rate car service.
In any event, it was probably my mistake as I should have used Select Seven or some other service that I knew would be good.

We are Marriott Rewards customers (albeit the basic level), and were assigned a room on the ground floor - with a very narrow door, making
it hard to push our luggage through. This was almost laughable since the rooms on the opposite side of the hall had standard sized doors.

rapidly - and I would recommend the Doubletree down off of Sepulveda.
The other matter I took issue with during my stay was the large gathering that was held the morning of our departure. Since we were on the ground floor, and since there was an entry-exit at the end of our hall, it became very noisy in the morning as the group filed in, and furthermore, many members of that group were smokers so the hall was quite malodorous by the time we departed. Apparently, no effort was made to prevent the attendees from smoking in the lodging hallways.
On the bright side, corporate policy allows for a - PM departure upon
request - although that is done via the internet before one's arrival.
In summary, I would like to compliment the staff - to a person, they were pleasant and affable. To the management - rather than nickel-and-diming your flight crews, why not bundle everything so they will want to visit your property when traveling on leisure?

I must say that after reading the mixed reviews on this site, I was apprehensive about stopping here. However, we were very pleasantly surprised. 
The plus sides of the hotel were: 
- the main areas of the hotel are beautifully decorated; very ornate 
- price; very good value
- location; it's very central and close to brilliant shops - restaurants - Boston Common - Cheers, etc
- our room was comfortable (the bed was great) and large (room ----) 
- MJ O'Connors Irish Bar; well, we were there over Paddy's Day! 
The downsides to the hotel were: 
- it's very busy (it appears to host lots of conferences); check-in took a whole and the general phone numbers weren't answered quickly
- it was noisy first thing in the morning; we were at the back of the hotel right above the loading bays 
- the staff weren't particularly friendly 
- they didn't have a UK - US adapter (despite telling us that they had), and we were unable to locate one in town. Lesson learnt - if you're planning to use UK electrical equipment, don't forget to bring an adapter with you!",Edge,Mobile,not happy

The next issue we had was trying to make phone calls using the business center.

Sheets on the bed were musty smelling and housekeeping was marginal.

Although we had booked a 'Superior Room', the room was tiny and most of the furniture fittings and wall coverings had seen better days. On the website the rooms looked spacious light and airy. In reality they were small gloomy and grubby. We had to lift our suitcases over the bed of the L shaped room as there was not room to wheel them past. After looking at the room we called the front desk to ask if alternatives were available. After - attempted calls when the phone went unanswered we finally got through and expressed our disappointment. We were offered a larger room on a higher floor, although we were warned that it did not 'have a view'. The current 'view from the room we were currently in was of the back of a building and a car park, so we decided to take the risk.
The next room we were given had more room only in that the bed was barely bigger than a single, the desk and chair had been removed and the TV was half the size of the previous room. There was not even room anywhere for the coffee machine which had been situated in the bathroom. There was no wardrobe, but there was a small single sized built in cupboard housing electrical and telephone switchgear with a small rail. Although we had booked a room with 'free' WiFi, it did not reach this room, and without a desk I would have been unable to do any work or use my laptop.
I attempted to contact the front desk once more and after another - calls which were unanswered again got through to the front desk. I explained that this room was in no way 'superior' and was in fact smaller and less well equipped than the previous room. I was told that no other rooms were available, but that if we wanted to move back to the first room we were offered I could do so. However I was advised that for an additional $--- we could upgrade to a suite the following day, when bookings were 'wide open'. By this time we were now running late for a dinner appointment, so we agreed to stay in the current room, on condition we could move to a suite the following day. We were told that if we packed our suitcases in the morning when we left the hotel staff would move them to a suite the following afternoon, and we could collect keys when we returned in the evening.
The following morning on leaving the hotel for the day, we handed back our keys asked for confirmation of the move to a suite. We were told in a very offhand manner that there was no possibility of such a move as the hotel was fully booked. The desk clerk disputed that we could have been told the above information about a room change. We then asked to speak to the duty manager who was quite frankly very rude, and was completely unconcerned that our weekend was being ruined. By this time staff had lied to me twice, about the move to the 'bigger' room the previous day, and about a suite being available today. I noticed the manager was smirking at my annoyance and I suggested that this was inappropriate and she laughed in my face. This suggested to me that this staff attitude permeates the hotel, and that no one has any genuine wish to look after their guests needs or satisfaction.
As a frequent business and leisure traveler I have never before experienced such a terrible product, or staff who give the impression that they are completely unconcerned about customer care and satisfaction. I the attitude of the (female) duty manager on the morning of Saturday - June was completely unacceptable for someone in the service and hospitality industry and I cannot understand how on earth she was ever given a position of responsibility. 
 Luckily we moved to the Hudson hotel, which for a similar room rate was in a totally different league, and the staff could not have been more friendly or helpful.

Also our doorbell was randomly rang at - AM and no one was there when we got up and looked...since there isn't any real security and anyone can get on the grounds, we were a little suspcious of that. 
All in all, not terrible for a night's stay, but nothing special. I think it would be more appealing if you were staying a few nights or using the facility for a golf vacation, since its not too close to the interstate.",Mozilla,Mobile,not happy
id10943,"If given the option, we stay at Renaissance hotels. This hotel wasn't as nice as other Renaissance hotels. No complaints because the price was terrific, but I would look at other hotels before booking this one, because there are cheaper w- = quality. The rooms are small (bathrooms are nice size). The lobby was nice, the front desk was friendly. However, the rooms reminded me of a renovated Crowne Plaza. The beds are comfortable, but I wasn’t impressed with the pillows. We always get upgraded, but didn’t here. We ordered room service one night and only one meal out of three was correct, when you are ordering a $-- grilled cheese, you expect perfection :-) The pool area was nice, but the hot tub didn’t have enough water and it took well over hours upon reporting to get filled, I don’t even know how long because we didn’t stay any longer. In short, I would recommend this hotel to a friend if it was the right price, but there are other hotels I would first recommend. The location is okay, but I have enjoyed other locations more too.

id10946,"Our room was nicely appointed and was as pictures portrayed, it was right on the river although quite a walk to where the restaurants and shops were located unless you went by street which we did. The lobby was fantastic staff very friendly, parking drive was a bit crazy and scary since everybody was driving in and out very fast and it was extremely crowded but that goes with staying in a downtown hotel. The bed was not their heavenly bed as we expected and expect from Westin. I suspect they either substituted a cheaper replacement or something because it was horrible. We were close to street and the noise was enough to drive you crazy, I don't know where it all came from but we heard kids and adults carrying on till the wee hours. The room A-C control is one of those fake controls, you can't change the temp and it wouldn't matter if you tried, you will get what they want you to have. So it's enough to survive, better than outside, but NOT comfortable. After walking a long way to and from the restaurant we would have enjoyed a comfortable bed and some a-c with --% humidity so we were disappointed. We paid $--- plus plus plus so the total tab for - night was $---.-- using priceline and paying for valet parking. We expect to pay $-- for parking despite the parking garage charging $-- for -- hours but the valets drive your car like mad men, don't like that.

So when you stay on the river be prepared to pay a lot and enjoy you room minimally even in a --star facility. It's noisy, expensive, and most are not maintained as well as they should be, parking is overpriced, you have to tip everyone for everything but if you want to stay on the Riverwalk it's part of it. I'd never pay their rack rates or call direct for reservations, knowing what I know I'd always do Priceline if you want to endure all that it takes to stay on the Riverwalk.

Arrived with wife on -th Oct having booked a standard room for - nights for - adults. On entering -th Floor Room alloacted, seriously thought we had been given a single room as bed was small and only towels for one in bathroom. Room was dark, stuffy and very noisy . Questioned the size of room with reception staff only to be told in no uncertain terms that this was a standard room which I had booked. I was unable to pay for an upgrade as informed there were only - other rooms available and all were of the standard quality.I was then shown the button on the phone that I would need to press to contact housekeeping for extra towels, but the guy on reception said he would press it 'this time' and arrange for additional towels to be sent (Wow service at its best !!!).
On returning to the room found my wife cleaning the skirting boards of accumulated dust and grime. The bathroom was very tired with the shower producing nothing more than a dribble and the shower head had seen better days. Both the bath and basin has surface cracks and scratches which were stained. On turning on the air conditioning found that it drowned out any conversation and the sound from the tv. The windows in the room provided no sound proofing from the sounds of the street and therefore as New York never sleeps neither did we !!!
Unable to rest at all with the air conditioning switched on so room gradually became uncomfortable through the night.
Deadlock on the door also was faulty and did not work so security was a concern.

id10955,"I like the Hilton brand hotels and stay frequently. Booked the brand new HGI Inner Harbor for a weekend family getaway. I was delighted but disappointed all in the same trip. The pros - the hotel is brand new and the location is fabulous - close to all inner harbor attractions. Since the hotel is new, it is very very clean (spotless actually) and the rooms are modern and cozy. They are a little small, but I find that common with any big city hotel. But overall, I was satisified w- the accomodations. We had a room on the --th floor (top floor) with a nice view of the inner harbor. The odd # rooms face towards the harbor-city. The cons are that because the hotel was new, I think the staff was too. Service can use a Hilton make over. Check in was very slow. The clerk seemed genuinely unwelcoming and uninterested that I chose his hotel to stay in. He provided no information and barely made eye contact. The hotel is co-located w- the Homewood Suites by Hilton so be careful to go to the correct desk & elevators. Homewood clerks had no action but stood at their stations staring at - of us in line to check in to the HGI without offering any of us assistance. When I got to my room the card keys didn't work and my wife had to keep my three small children out in the hall while I went back down to rectify the problem. I barely got an apology and was told I probably put them next to my cell phone (meanwhile my cell was in my bag on the baggage cart so it was impossible for that to have happened). I told the guy that wasn't the case and he just handed me my keys and said """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""here you go."""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" Not Hilton-esque service! After we got settled, we attempted to order room service but the book in the room didn't have a menu. We called to ask for one and I actually had to go down to the restaurant to go get one (that's what the staff suggested when I called). They said they hadn't gotten the in-room menus yet. No offer to bring one up to us.
To access the pool, you need a separate pass to the health club (non Hilton facility in the same building, but guests can get in with a pass and photo ID ). Ask at check in b-c they don't tell you about it when you do check in. Also, you should inquire about parking so you can get an in-out access card - again you aren't told by the staff, you have to ask for everyting. It's $-- but that is actually a bargain for the area especially with in-out priveleges. Main attractions are in walking distance anyway.
Ate breakfast at the Great American grill. Food was good but very slow at the counter - they cook to order eggs, pancakes, etc.. There was a wedding party so that may have contributed. Restaturant staff was friendly and helpful, but again, you could tell the hotel was new in operation and all parts weren't moving in the same directions quite yet. We walked by the General Manager's office on the way out and he looked up with a mean grimmace. Not even a good morning or anything. Not so friendly like I'm used to at other Hiltons.
Overall, I was pleased with the room, the cleanliness, and the location. The level of service needs to be improved for me to consider it of Hilton quality. I would call my stay an """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Ok"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" experience and I would consider it again after the staff was properly trained and had some experience under there belt.",Mozilla,Desktop,not happy

After staying here for one night, while attending a wedding onsite, I'll have to say I think management should focus more on being a hotel and less on being an experience.
The positive things about the hotel are evident from the website. The rooms are unique, the modern decoration is attractive, and the location is fantastic. I attended a wedding reception, which used the roof bar for cocktail hour, and the views are simply amazing. It's a very hip, fun place to hang out.
But, I really can't recommend spending your money to sleep here. To start, there was a parade going on downtown, and we could not navigate the streets to get to the hotel. We called the front desk to ask for directions, and for help on where to park since the parking entrance was blocked by the parade. The front desk literally knew nothing. Despite the fact that the parade was marching by their front door, no one had any information about the route, or timing, or how to park at the hotel during this time. We finally had a friend drop us about a half mile from the hotel, and we walked over to discuss in person how he could drive up. They acted just as clueless in person as they had on the phone. Friend ended up parking elsewhere and walking over.
Second, after the wedding reception ended, the bride invited the group to the rooftop bar to continue the party. What we were not told, by hotel management, is that after a certain hour only one elevator takes you to the roof, so we would have to go downstairs, go outside, wait in line, get a wrist band, then take the elevator back upstairs. Not realizing this, myself and a few others went in to the stairwell from the floor we were on for dinner to walk up to the roof. There was a bouncer at the door who would not let us in, which is annoying to begin with, but that alone wouldn't make me complain. However what was simply unbelievable is that he would not escort us to the elevator to let us out, and instead left us LOCKED in the stairwell on the top floor! None of the doors on other floors opened, until the ground floor. And, I was wearing heels. He would not call anyone to come let us in, even after we begged and explained that we were hotel guests trying to get to our room, he simply told us we had to leave and walk all the way down. We started banging on the doors at each floor, and a hotel patron heard us and opened from the inside and let us in. Needless to say I did not bother trying to get back to the club.
Back in our room, which was on a middle floor, closer to the top than bottom, to add insult to inury we could hear the music from the club while we tried to sleep! My friend was on a floor above us and said it was so loud she couldn't sleep at all. It wasn't awful where I was, but definitely you could still hear it.

My --year old loved the ponds and lagoons filled with ducks and other exotic birds (buy feed in the market and you will be surrounded by them!). We mainly stayed at the larger pool, which had bar and grill service. The pool is nothing fancy, but not very deep, so we did not have to worry as much. I wish that there were slides or a water feature--something to make the pool stand out. 
The room was fine--again, nothing fancy, but pretty large for a standard garden room (make sure that yours is NOT overlooking the parking lot). We enjoyed the chairs on our patio overlooking one of the lagoons--we brought a couple of bottle of wine and were able to chill it in the in-room fridge. There are NO luxuries (some would say, no basics even)...no robe, not water bottles, no turn-down service, no hair dryer, only - glasses and - paper cups for coffee. In fact, we returned to our room at -pm one day and it STILL had not had maid service--we called and it was close to -pm when she came. Not happy about that. But, on the whole, the room was clean and pleasant. They still have the ancient in-wall A-C which needs updating. There was also bits of trash around the entrance of our room--it is these small details which completely keeps the place from truly being a resort.
BUT, the Barefoot and Baleen Restaurants are excellent--really good food, nice ambiance, generous portions. Room service was fast and delicious. My child cried when it was time to leave because we did not have enough time to do all that there is to do (we missed the movie at night over the pool, the bike rides, fire pits on the beach). SO, in some ways it was fantastic, some ways, completely disappointing.

For those of you who want a quick summary, it's here at the top, the details are all below.
Summary:
------------
Cons:
* beds were small, ac was noisy, rooms smell of vapor-rub
* avoid the pool and hot-tub Sunday evening through Wednesday night - it's a health hazard
* outdoor area has mosquitos, bring bug spray for evenings outdoors in the restaurant or at the pool area
* family budget: restaurant is typical san diego prices which are expensive for a family, eat elsewhere if possible if you're on a budget or utilize the restaurants happy hour for a good deal -- the food we did have was good tho.
* you cannot SAFELY walk to the beach from this hotel, even tho it's advertised as such
Pros:
* Rooms were clean, comfortable, and well appointed. Hotel was in a business neighborhood and we felt safe at the hotel.
* Shuttle service was prompt and helpful for trips to the beach
* Pool area was fun and well designed (but only use when the pool has been cleaned)
* well located for access to san-diego - seaworld, and legoland
The only reason we stayed here is because we got a --% off deal on the room, and it was close to the beach, and it looked like the pool area would be great for the kids, which turned out to be NOT the case because the pool was so dirty during most of our stay there. I would not stay here again at the same ($--- per night with) or full price.
Details:
----------
-. The rooms are decent sized, beds are comfortable, it was clean. The 'queen' beds are actually doubles or very close to it -- much smaller 'queens' than in any other hotel we've stayed at. The kids were accidentally kicking and hitting each other at night, The room's a-c unit was very loud, not just the normal fan sound but a loud buzzing background noise as well -- if you are a light sleeper that needs to be cool I would suggest avoiding this hotel. The rooms smell like vapor rub -- other reviewers said that the rooms smelled, and maybe this is the hotels way of trying to freshen it up, it wasn't over-powering to us, but when you arrived it was noticeable for the first - minutes or so.
-. Food and amenities -- the hotel nickels and dimes you for amenities like internet access ($---day) we didn't use it, because both our smart phones have -G. Eating out in San Diego is expensive, and the hotels restaurant is no exception. We avoided the breakfast buffet at $-- per adult, $- - kid, and instead walked a block to the nearby Green Leaf Cafe (a business cafe) and got a decent breakfast for the whole family for $---$--. We also found that the hotels happy happy hour between ---pm was great, and during that time would split a few appetizers ($--- each vs $----- per entree during regular hours) for dinner with the kids, however most nights we didn't make it back to the hotel until after happy hour was over.
-. The pool -- if you have kids who love to swim, and are coming to this hotel to use the pool, be WARNED, there are some caveats.To save money the hotel only turns on their pool pump and cleans their pool once per week, and they do it just in time for the largest arrival of guests which is on Thursday and Friday. We arrived on Monday night, and about the first thing we did was jump into the hot tub and pool -- and in about - minutes we were disgusted (rating D-). There were arm sized clumps of human hair floating around the bottom of the pool, there was some kind of deteriorating paper item in the bottom of the pool (maxipad, diaper, or tissue -- I'm not sure but who wanted to get close enough to find out). In addition to the gross stuff on the bottom, the tops of the pool and hot tub were covered in leafs, bugs, normal pool debris, etc. The pool pump and filters were NOT running. There was a large brown bathtub ring around the top edge of the hot-tub. In addition, there were mosquitos outside, and I ended up getting bitten several times that evening, even tho we were outdoors for about -- min.
All of us who swam that night (me and the two kids) had red spots on our skin and few itchy bumps show up in the next few days -- tea tree oil was great for getting rid of these. I was ready to report the hotel pool to the del mar health department the next day.
We avoided the pool for the next few days, mostly because as our schedule had it we were slated for the beach, sea world, and legoland -- but also beacuse we hoped that the dirty pool was an oversight or the result of a broken pump and it would be better the next time. Friday morning we had a chance to check out the pool again, and it looked to our amazement, much better -- I would say a B+ rating. Friday night they had a movie showing in the pool area, which was a lot of fun -- and the pool was clean enough our kids actually enjoyed swimming in it.
Other reviewers also commented on the disgusting pool, and an fun pool so the schedule explains how both can be accurate.
-. Laundry -- there is no laundry room in this hotel that guests can do their laundry in -- very disapointing. As we expected to be able to split up and let the kids stay in the pool with one of us, while the other took care of the laundry. The hotel does have a laundry service, but given the prices of everything else there, I suspect it would have added another nights worth of cost or more to our bill to do a family of fours --days worth of laundry -- so we ended up having to leave the pool and movie, and spend Friday night at the landromat at del mar heights, and ate dinner next door with the kids while the clothes washed. 
-. Shuttle: The hotel provides a free shuttle to anywhere within - miles of the hotel, which includes del mar beach -- this was the best beach we found for quality (bathrooms and changing area were amazing here) and crowd we had plenty of space to ourselves. When I called the hotel to ask about the shuttle service and other questions, the operator was fairly curt and impatient. But the shuttle service was nice -- the picked us up at a cafe we found near the beach.
-a. Speaking of the beach: the booking site we used said you could walk to the beach from the hotel. We asked at the front desk while we were there, and they said there was NO safe way to walk to the beach from this hotel, unless you wanted to walk along the interstate freeway with young kids. This seems like false advertising to me.
-. Yelp -- if you have a smart phone and a car, Yelp! came in extremely handy for finding good places with decent prices to eat. The GPS-google maps were also invaluable.",Firefox,Tablet,not happy

Walking down the hallways felt like walking through a crappy motel in central Europe - dirty, worn carpet, and old, excessively narrow doors. Attention to detail was seriously lacking - even the plate with my room number on it in the hall way had been wiped with an excessively-dirty sponge and the dirty water had dried all over it - I would say that this is a metaphor for the entire hotel.

My bed was super comfortable, and the hotel was very, very quiet (and I was next to a stairwell!).

First, let me say that the lobby and ballrooms are lovely and evocative of Versailles. Do not leave the lobby as it truly goes downhill from there.
The hotel was overbooked and gave our group smoking rooms. I don't smoke, but am not an obsessive anti-smoker and usually have no problem in this situation. THESE ROOMS WERE VILE! The smoke smell was unbelievably oppressive. No one had attempted to air it, Febreze it or even spray a bit of Glade. For the days I was there, I avoided my room until absolutely ready to sleep, as did my travel mates.
Check out was at --AM, and we were giving a presentation from -----:-- and asked for a noon check-out.

Beware of extra charges. The hotel imposes service fees for your stay on top of the room fee and taxes. Also, in the coffee shop, I was overcharged. I asked for cappuccino, but the machine was broken. That did not stop the young women for charging me cappuccino price for a regular coffee.

id11180,"I must say, for the amount of travel I do for my job, I generally have good luck with the hotels that I stay in. Unfortunately, I cannot say that for the L'enfant Plaza. From the moment I checked in, I had issues. 
I ended up checking in at about --:-- in the evening - upon receiving my room key, I proceeded to my room on the top floor of the hotel. Upon entering my room, it sounded as though they booked me in the engine room of a cruise ship - the room was extremely loud, and I suspect that the air conditioning unit for the entire hotel was directly above this room. 
Knowing I wouldn't get a wink of sleep if I stayed in this room, I proceeded back to the front desk where I was told that the only room available was a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""parlor"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" room. If you've read some of the other reviews of this hotel, you will immediately know that this is actually a room that doesn't have a bed. Wonderful... So my choices are the engine room or a room without an actual bed. I chose the latter....
Up to this room I headed.... The room was quite large, with a dining table that sat at least - people. The carpets were stained in multiple areas, and there were a number of cobwebs on the light fixtures. Again - I'm not too pleased with the room, but they had promised to move me to an actual room the following day. Since I was tired, and the only thing that they'd end up doing for me is putting me in another parlor room, I sucked it up and stayed in this room.
To the hotel's credit, they did move me to a suitable room the following day and did comp me a breakfast in their restaurant. The room that I ended up in after the first night was clean, but as many others have commented, this place needs a significant remodeling - the place reminded me of a late ----'s Marriott.
I was attending a conference at this hotel, and must also mention two things. First of all, the first day of the meeting, the air conditioning in the conference room was not working sufficiently. Many in attendance were visibly uncomfortable from the heat and humidity (myself included) - it made it difficult to concentrate. Also, the cellular and wifi signals in the conference rooms are non-existent. When you exit the room, the signal is fine in the foyer, but poor in the actual room. This made it difficult for me because I had a couple of calls I was expecting, so I found myself nervously exiting the room regularly.
One last experience I must mention... On the second night, I visited the bar and had a couple of drinks. When ready to retire for the evening, I asked for the bill and noticed that I was overcharged by one drink. When I brought it to the attention of the bartender, I was met with arguing that I did, in fact, have the drink in question. I like to consider myself a trustworthy person, and for the bartender to argue with me and question my truthfulness was an insult to me. I wasn't trying to scam him out of money, nor would it have been any skin off his back to just correct the bill. Knowing that I wasn't getting anywhere, I ended up just paying for the extra drink and leaving a lousy tip. He argued his way out of his tip.....
If I ever have to attend a meeting at this hotel in the future, I will probably stay elsewhere and use the Metro to get to the L'enfant - the Metro is actually conveniently located under the hotel, which makes getting around town quite convenient.

Great location and spacious rooms. But I found the service to be very slow (i asked for some items from housekeeping and ended up having to go down and get it myself!). They do not provide basic amenities (toothbrushes, razors) for free - when you call housekeeping they just connect you to their souvenir shop! 
There is a rooftop pool and (supposedly) an excellent gym, but guests need to pay for access, which i thought was stingy and it defeated the purpose of my move to this hotel (this was not mentioned on their site). I checked out the pool but it looked much smaller than expected and it was full of kids so I didn't bother in the end (the pool was one of the reasons I picked the hotel!!)

Stayed for - nights in early August and booked direct with hotel. 
First night: although we specifically asked for a high-floor, we ended up on the second floor, bar side. This is because, of course, this is not really a hotel but a time-share with occasional availability of rooms and the part-owners want the best rooms. Nothing wrong with that, but the room was not good. Spartan, worn down (reminded me of Eastern European hotels in the --s) and VERY noisy given pubs across the street. -*. Fortunately staff at reception managed to move us to the --th floor the second night: what a difference. Fantastic room, great furnishings, spectacular views.... -*.
In the end we were grateful for the swap and appreciate they were under no obligation to move us but the difference was spectacular and for $--- a night the room on the -nd floor was a joke. 
Great top floor 'games' room behind the clock in this famous Boston landmark though. Breakfast was mediocre and a bit weird as room was too small, historic as it was.

This place was recommended by The Price Is Right website. We still aren't sure why though. When we checked in it was - AM. There was no one at the front desk and we had to ring the doorbell for about -- minutes before anyone came to the desk. The man that came to the desk had obviously been sleeping in the back room(it was the owner) and was not wearing shoes or socks. He was a bit annoyed with us that we were checking in earlier than we had previously thought. After we got to our room, we discovered that the room we had thought we were booking with two queen size beds had only one queen and one full. The phone's apparent place was on the back of the couch. And there was carpet pulled up on the side of one of the beds. When my dad laid down to go to sleep, his headboard from the bed fell over on him. I was a bit thrown off when I was in the midst of a shower and discovered that the motel does not provide complimentary shampoo or conditioner. 
The layout of the motel is very Beverly Hills. The architecture of the Inn was nice. It was -- degrees in L.A. and the pool was not heated. So even though a pool was advertised, it is outside and was not usable while we were there due to the weather. There is an ice machine on the -st floor which requires -- cents to use. Ice buckets are available upon request. So when we went to request one, we were told the ice machine had broken down earlier that day. 
When we arrived we even found a lovely hair in one of our beds, however, while we were there, the room got cleaned pretty well. There was actually a couple of times that the hot water seemed to be running short. And the walls were paper thin. It was possible to hear other occupants in their rooms. 
Their website said they did not provide breakfast, so we were pleasantly surprised when we found that coffee and honeybun type pastries had been sat out in the main lobby on a couple of mornings. 
We made this trip strictly for a Price is Right experience. So under this premise, we found the motel very lacking in some areas, yet quite sufficient for the price that close to Hollywood and Beverly Hills.

Prior to booking our stay, we inquired about parking and was told parking was available at a garage next store. We booked our stay at the Buckmister as we thought a garage would be more secure than a surface lot. 
Our car was broken into and items taken sometime during the night. Both the garage and hotel disclaim any responsibility. The parking garages policy of closing one hour after the game basically means the employees go home at such time NOT that the lot is secured. In fact no gates are closed, security cameras are facing backwards -- it does not appear that the garage takes reasonable care in protecting the overnight cars.
The hotel claims that they simply reimburse the garage for the discount being given hotel guests and the hotel is not involved in the operation of the garage -- fair enough -- but it is very misleading for the hotel to represent that parking is nearby - when they know the parking is not secure overnight.

After a long night out we got back to the room and it was still -- degreeds. I called the front desk and they sent an engineer. It was after midnight and he was still trying to figure out what's going on; we made the most of it by having a glass of wine on the patio under an umbrella in the rain. We were told it was fixed. It wasn't. I had a terrible sleep. 
There are three things I need from a hotel. Internet (which costs $-- a night but they were good enough to comp those charges). Hot water (which came eventually, turn your shower on and wait for a while before jumping in). And, most importantly, a good nights sleep. Night one was a write off; it was too hot and humid for me to sleep.
The next morning I talked to the people at the front desk. I said there were two options, that the AC be fixed or that we move to another room but that I preferred the former as all our cloths were in drawers and we were rather settled in. They said they would call either way and that I need not worry, that """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""they would take care of me."""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" They didn't follow through with either. We got back to the hotel at -:--am after a long -- hour day out in NYC. I called the front desk to find out if the room AC was looked into (no call, no note, nada) and was told there was no record on the file. The second night of sleep in a hot room with a warm comforter was equally miserable. 
Unable to sleep I got up early and requested to talk with the manager. I talked with Jordon, Director of the Front Office. He was helpful and told me he'd contact me soon. Within half an hour we were moving rooms from --- to --- as he couldn't guarantee the AC would be fixed. As were were trying to pack up and move from one room to the next an engineer came down to look at the AC. Surely he could have waited until we were out of the room.
We were not charged for either of the first two hot nights and our points were restored. While I recognize these things happen it took two days to resolve the issue and two sleepless nights; that is unacceptable.
The hotel looked nice but there were little issues that added to the frustration. The first terrace didn't have a table. The second had a table but it was covered in bird feces and was never cleaned. The remote in the first room for the entertainment unit didn't work. The entry floor in the first room was sticky. In both rooms, even though the reservation was for two, there was only one robe (and one umbrella). In both rooms the bamboo shelve above the toilet was on a slant and looked like it was falling off the wall. The art's side matting in the first room was falling into the picture blocking the image. In the first room the sliding door wouldn't stay closed, in the second it wouldn't stay open and it was improperly installed so it hit the wall resulting in smashed tiles. We drank the complimentary in-room espresso coffee but the coffee was not refreshed the following day (this happened twice) by house keeping.
While the initial impression was good and the staff were very polite, when I needed high quality customer service I got lip service. When I'm told """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""we'll take care of you,"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" I don't want to be appeased, I want to be impressed, and at the very least pleased. If you're moving guests from one room to another because the first room was not satisfactory, you had best go over the second room with a fine tooth comb before letting them in.
The final frustration was upon checkout (at -:--am) I looked at the bill and we were charged for a water from the minibar. We didn't take anything from the minibar. They quickly removed the charge but the fact that it was there in the first place should never have happened. 
In New York we have also stayed at the Hilton New York, both were memorable but it certainly wasn't for the same reasons. Perhaps the Hyatt can sell this property to Joie de Vivre or a similar boutique hotel chain, at the very least they can certainly learn something from them when it comes to impressing their guests.
If everything goes right, you're in for a wonderful stay. The beds are soft. The rooms are beautiful and quite. The staff is polite and friendly. 
If something goes wrong I wouldn't hold your breath. While it may be resolved it could take a few attempts and may leave a bitter taste in your mouth. 
A note to all hotel management. Comping a nights stay is a good start but it's not going to bring me back. Proving that you care about my business (even if I used points) and want it in the future means going above and beyond. It's extraordinary what a complimentary bottle of champagne or a personal note does to leave a good and lasting impression.

id11447,"I stayed one night for business. I would rate the actual hotel a -.- but several factors went into the overall - rating. The interior of the hotel and rooms are in good shape, seems like it has been rennovated some time in the past few years. The furnishings, bedding and room were all in good shape. The room was large and the staff was helpful and friendly.
There was plenty of outlets to plug-in all your gagets, the flat Screen TV was large, the internet was very fast and consistent (no dropping) and the hotel was very clean.
The outside doesn't seem like it was rennovated but the hotel doesn't look bad from the outside. They charge $---night for parking which is reasonable for downtown Boston but the hotel isn't in downtown, it is several miles away. The price of the actual room was good enough that the $-- is more than reasonable.
A couple of negatives that made me give the overall rating a -. First, there was one person at the Desk and there was a substantial number of folks that needed to be checked in. He did a great job getting us all checked in as quickly as possible but it still took a while. I am not sure how busy the hotel was but they could have used a second person at the front desk.
There is no real restaurant onsite and or with-in walking distance. The onsite facility was a sandwhich shop, cafe type place that also had a couple of """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""dinner"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" like options such as buffalo wings, a burger, etc. The Cafe also had hot breakfast items but I skipped breakfast because the sandwhich I had at was not particularly good. 
Doubletrees are a bit all over the place in terms of amenities and theme but this is the first one I have ever stayed at that didn't have a real restaurant onsite. My guess is this place was another brand before the rennovations and when the rennovations were completed they changed the branding to a Doubletree.
The heat was a little too loud and definitely louder than I would have expected. Also, it was hard to control the room not being too cold or too hot.
The hotel is convenient to the T like the other reviewers said but it was still about a mile. The hotel is also near the UMASS campas and the JFK Library. Unoess you want to eat at the cafe you will need to drive to find a restaurant. The area is a little confusing so get direction

We ordered Eggs Benedict, Ham and Eggs, Sticky Bun french toast, and waffles. Again everything was presented very nicely and tasted great.
Hotel Room
We stayed in the -th floor of the tower, with a marina view and - queen beds. We were not charged anything extra, even though we were paying a Hotwire price of $---.--. The room was plenty spacious for my family of four (- kids aged -- and -). The beds were comfortable, as well as the pillows. The ceiling was the old acoustic ceiling type material; the wait staff told us they were going to be renovating soon. My only complaint would be the bathroom: fan was very noisy, lighting poor, and showerhead needed upgrading. But adequate for our needs. Room was clean, and did not smell. Yes, decor needs updating, and a more luxurious feel if you are going to pay full rates - - but not """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""disgusting"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" by any means.
Location
We picked the Islandia mainly due to its proximity to SeaWorld, which we were attending for - days. Its proximity to the water, I-- and I-- made it appealing as well. We also chose the Islandia because we got a good Hotwire price and it was tagged a Customer favorite on that site.

The box spring even had mold on it. I found a mouse trap next to the window and saw a cockroach near the ice machine. One of the elevators was out of order and trash was piled in front of it. It smelled. There were no refrigerators available and I had to ask for a blow dryer. It was difficult to find parking. I was surprised how many guests were there.

Also, the plastic on the cups had been ripped open, and the beverage tray looked like it had not been restocked for some time. The air-conditioning in the fitness center was broken, and since it was --° and muggy, this meant the fitness center was unusable. The elevator was also broken, so we had to lug our bags up the stairs.
The two worst problems were that our data port did not work and the room was not serviced. First, I complained at the front desk that phone didn’t work. The clerk tried calling the room and said that it should. I asked to try another phone jack to see if perhaps my computer was problem. The clerk said no and suggested that I try an Internet café downtown. Second, after the first day, we found a note in the room saying the bed could not be made because something had been left on it. However, the room had not been serviced at all: no towels, cleaning, or trash removal. I complained at the desk, but they said because the cleaning staff had left for the day, all they could offer me were towels. I was told that it was the hotel's policy not to make the bed if any personal items at all had been left on it. It would've been nice to have known this beforehand. This also made me wonder if, since the housekeeping staff was so easily persuaded not to clean, anything in the room had been cleaned before we arrived.
Because the hotel has a ---% satisfaction guarantee, I told the manager we should not have to pay for our room.

The hotel is spotless and the staff is very friendly and ready to help with anything. We did eat at the buffet a couple of times. My husband loved it because of all the sushi-shashimi they had but I am not fond of that so I found the buffet to be just mediocre at best. In my opinion I have been to better buffets for less money. There was also a huge religious group staying there while we were there and they became very annoying. Apparently it was some kind of convention for them and I am all for freedom of religion (I am Roman Catholic and go to church regularly and pray) but these people are in your face about believing the way they do and preaching the bible while you are waiting on line for coffee or inviting you to services in the elevator and if you say no they again start preaching.

When they brought the spa detail, sure enough there were two charges for the rooftop café for $-- each when we had already paid $-- with tip for the meal. Were we entitled to a $-- per person fixed price lunch as part of our package? I don't know because no explanation was offered nor was any apology when I made them aware of the error.

The second thing that happened was that the housekeepers threw away my daughter's retainers which she left in the bathroom (where would you leave them?)
The hotel launched an investigation even though we weren't assuming a crime was involved! We only wanted them to check the garbage and laundry and to reimburse us the cost of replacement.

C) The rooms are decent-size. 
D) The staff is VERY accommodating.
E) The kitchen was well equipped and the maid even ran the dishwasher each time she cleaned the room, although we only had used coffee cups and glasses.
Unfortunately, there are many drawbacks to this hotel. 
A) The walls are EXTREMELY thin. We could hear conversations and, of course, television sets in the room next to ours - to the point where we had to keep the A-C running constantly to drown out the noise.
B) The tubs have no mats, so watch yourself. Our tub seemed to have the rough strips worn away (although the hotel isn't that old). I took a step into the tub and slipped immediately, landing hard outside of the tub. Be careful.
C) The bed was very lumpy and the sheets were thin.
D) There aren't that many towels and-or washcloths. I'm sure they would have provided more, if asked, but - to a room which holds up to - people isn't enough.

My experience with Millennium hotels is that there is always a line-up to check-in since it seems that only one person works at the reception. The worst is to line up just to ask a question. The concierge doesn’t seem to be on her station often.
Since this was an old building, the rooms are smaller than the average rooms in more modern buildings so there is a disconnect between square feet and price charged. The bathroom is updated with modern fixtures and a rain showerhead.
The mattress and the sheets were excellent but the pillows has absolutely no firmness. I am not sure what are in the pillows but they provided no support to my head and neck. When I lay my head down on them, my head just sank to the bottom. I woke up with neck strains every morning. 
The air conditioner was noisy so I turned it off every night before going to sleep but there was also a loud humming noise from the mini-fridge that comes on intervals.
Don’t expect to have great views because it is a low rise building. The area is near upscale shops but it is not vibrant. There aren’t many eateries nearby so you might have to make a short walk to Rush\State Street if you want better selections.

They rated the Melrose as a - star hotel and nothing could be further from the truth. Tripadvisor reviews were not overwhelmingly positive and with good reason, however the Priceline system locks you in once they accept your bid.
Positives: We had a large, quiet room on a high floor facing the back of the hotel. The bathroom sink was in a separate area outside of the actual bathroom. The staff were pleasant and friendly. The location is terrific - a few blocks away from the Foggy Bottom Metro station and Georgetown restaurants. We ate in Georgetown both nights. Tackle Box on M Street is fun, the food is tasty and it is reasonably priced. Whenever we stay near Georgetown we eat breakfast at Le Madeleine. 
Negatives: Overnight valet parking (no other option offered) was $-- a day plus tips for the parking attendant. There are no other options for overnight parking in the area. Trust me, I called every single garage company in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood prior to our trip and none of them offer overnight parking. My husband needed to walk to a different floor to obtain ice since the ice machine on our floor was not functioning. There were no glasses in the room for drinks. He called down to the desk and they sent someone up to the room with a few wrapped plastic cups. There are apparently no glasses available. Although housekeeping remade the bed, and replaced towels the next day, they did not pick up the used plastic cups (clearly unwrapped) nor did they replace them for the second night with fresh cups.

id11852,"During my most recent stay in Los Angeles during June-July ---- on a business trip within the Sheraton Four Points Hotel at Los Angeles I was the victim of a fraud by one of their employees.
When I was checking out I settled the respective bill with cash (approximately $--), rather than having it charged to the credit card I have registered upon check-in.
Before flying back to the uk I decided to take a few days in Las Vegas, where I stayed at the Hilton. I was initially alerted that there was an issue when I checked into the Las Vegas Hilton. The same card I had used in Los Angeles was 'rejected' as payment for the room.
I immediately contacted my credit card company in the uk, who informed me that a charge of $--- had been made to the card by the Sheraton Four Points Hotel at LAX. This almost wiped out the remaining credit on the card, and as I did not have any other credit cards I was forced to use the limited cash I had on me, as a consequence I did not have the greatest two days in the city. I was unable to rent a car as had planned to do, plus I was also restricted to eating 'budget' food.
After two days a security supervisor from the credit card company called to inform me that they had been in direct contact with the Four Points Hotel, and the customer services manager had confirmed that a desk clerk had been fired as a consequence of a number of thefts. When visitors settled their hotel accounts in cash (as I did) the offending desk clerk would simply charge the amount to the registered credit card, then pocket the cash ($--- in my case)
When I reported the matter to the hotel they did not even apologise. However, after a number of letters and emails to the Starwood HQ they agreed that they would provide me with some level of 'compensation' which was in the form of either a free stay, or at least vouchers.
It will shortly be the FOURTH anniversary of the stay and I have still not received any vouchers, or indeed any physical confirmation that I would be provided with a free stay upon my next trip to the United States.
The reason this matter came to mind again is because I am flying out to Los Angeles later this month and I would like Starwood to provide me with what they promised.
I have sent them two letters over the last few weeks but they have failed to respond to any of them.
To say I am disappointed with the outcome of this matter would be an understatement. Not only was I the victim of theft, but the premeditated criminal actions of a Starwood Hotels employee robbed me of a relaxing stay in Las Vegas, and a trip to the Grand Canyon, which I had always dreamed of.
Needless to say, I shall never stay with any of their hotels ever again, and I would like to warn all visitors of the possibility of becoming a victim of theft whenever you stay with Starwood Hotels.

My partner and I wanted to throw a swanky surprise party in the Inner Harbor for my partner's mother's --th birthday. We had excellent experiences meeting with staff and signing contracts (the terms of which they changed and we didn't catch it upon signing!). Then everything went downhill.
When we showed up, the event room wasn't ready at the time we'd asked for it to be ready. Further, we couldn't discuss the catering, nor find any of the higher-ups with whom we'd struck agreements. Thus we had to try to coerce the work-a-day members of the staff to help us. We barely were able to start the surprise party successfully.
The food was okay, if wildly overpriced. Ditto the bar. Then, the Intercontinental charged us over a $---- more than we'd agreed upon for the bar!! Talking with them about this was completely insane. We never, in fact, were able to speak to the event coordinator or other people we'd spoken to prior to the event, and instead had to subject an unrelated day manager to our grievances. He dealt with us in a thoroughly bureaucratic manner--pleasant up front, but then dishonest. After telling us he would not charge us until we'd seen a bill (they had a problem furnishing an itemized bill right away, although they could tell us the lump total, surprisingly), and meeting with us so that we could review it together, he charged our accounts anyway, further to our surprise-dismay.
The hotel also attempted to charge us for rooms our party didn't rent, and the staff was mostly exceptionally rude and not fit to operate an elite hotel. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE, and certainly DON'T EVER TRY TO PLAN AN EVENT HERE.
As you'll note above, it might be easy to be duped by the quality of rooms and the location. But there's more to being an excellent hotel than the size of your rooms and location.

But then at night, UGH! There was this loud noise that sounded, at first like someone screaming, then later we figured out that it wasn't, but we still don't know that it definitely wasnt. I offered to pay for a stay at the Sheraton, but we decided to stick it out. The next day, we all had to use flip flops to shower with, and threw them away after, no one wanted to touch those things, let alone bring them back home. And when we checked out, it was the same RUDE woman. And they wouldnt even let us hold our bags there until actual checkout time since we got up early to shop some more.

id11886,"If you want modern decor-state of the art amenities, never mind. But the central location, a few blocks from the train station, historic district, good neighborhood, good access to public transportation (free bus stopping just across the street!), at a very reasonable price, makes the Rodeway Inn Mid Town a comfortable and convenient place to stay. The rooms are clean, and the staff very friendly and helpful. Just keep your sense of humor, think Fawlty Towers, and be especially kind to Tony, the maintenance man, and Jamal, the night desk clerk. They are super!
Some suggestions: 
Parking: travellers with autos have a problem. No """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""hotel"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" parking, either get lucky parking on the street, or pay expensive rates at nearby lots.

Local knowledge: Where is the nearest ATM machine? The all night shops (----)? It would be very handy for travelers staying more than one or two nights to print a map, and hand out copies to guests of useful information about the area. Not the historical stuff, there's already maps for that! For example, within a -- block radius, the ATM machines, banks, restaurants, convenience stores, grocery stores, drugstores, etc. 
Warning to international travelers: unless you have an account at one of the local banks, there is no place in Baltimore to exchange foreign currency! No, not the train station!

I found it very offensive and rude. The next morning we asked the desk person for one he pulled out a stack of “Bubba Gump” coupons and gave us one. The second thing is we booked through AAA rate, and this is noted on my Marriott rewards membership that I am a member of AAA. At check-in he wanted to see my membership card and I was fine with that but I notice the other two rooms which I booked for the other people in our party was not asked for their cards, they thought that was pretty funny since they are not AAA member and not Marriott rewards members.

id11929,"I would not recommend staying at the Clift. The common areas including the Redwood bar are beautiful so it’s a great spot as far as night life. I checked into one of their one bedroom suites on a Saturday evening. The room itself was generous in size but the bathroom was quite small and there was no half bath in living room of suite. None of that, however, was my problem with the hotel. My experience 
About half an hour after checking in I attempted to call down to room service and request a buck of ice. However, neither of the phones in the suite worked. This was not a huge deal so I picked up my cell phone and called the main reception line to request the bucket of ice. The hotel receptionist asked what room I was in and what the name on the account was. When I replied she told me that was not the name on the account and I would have to provide her with the correct account information before she could help me with my request. I explained that unfortunately I could not tell her what surname she was showing in the computer but I was most definitely checked in that room. This went in circles several times before she hung up on me. 
Thoroughly frustrated I left the room and took the elevator downstairs to speak with the manager on duty. He apologized and said that he would speak with the receptionist as well as send up a bucket of ice and maintenance to fix the phone. Perfect. About, fifteen minutes later someone came to fix the phone. Thirty minutes after that my bucket of ice still had not arrived and I had to call room service again. When the bucket of ice arrived it was two hours after I initially picked up the phone to request it. 
Later that evening my girlfriend and I returned to the suite with two friends. Less than ten minutes later there was a knock on the door from two large security guards that our neighbor was complaining about the music. The music was on very low and it was a Saturday night but not looking argue we turned the radio off all together and continued our conversation. At this point the same individuals in the next room begin banging furniture around and hitting the walls. I called down to the front desk to complain and as far as I can tell no one ever spoke them as this continued for ten or fifteen minutes. At this point there is a knock on our door again, the same two securities guards plus the female night manager. She informs us that now we are talking too loud and that she could hear our conversation from the elevator bank. I explain to her that is impossible that she head us talking, at a normal tone, all the way from the elevators and ask if they ever sent someone to speak with our noisy neighbors. She dodged the question and continues that we are being unruly and she would have to ask the two guests not staying at the hotel to leave. I explained to her that we were very much in our rights as hotel guest to hold a conversation within our room. She refused to see my point of view or accommodate us in any way, by moving the other guest or us. At this point, thoroughly frustrated, I told her that if this was how the Clift hotel treated its guests we would be leaving, to which she replied “fine”. We called American Express back and luckily they were able to find us a hotel nearby, the Palace, that was much more accommodating despite the late hour.
Upon checking out I spoke to the same manager again. I tried to rationalized with her that it was quite ridiculous to expect a hotel guest not to speak in their own room. She explained that the walls were thin and it probably had to do but the door adjoining our suite to the neighboring room. I cannot understand how it is the guest’s issue that the hotel is not properly sound proofed. I also asked her why she did not make an attempt to move either us or the next room over, before taking the extreme action of asking people to leave. She told me the hotel was fully booked. I find this hard to believe as I cannot see how we received an upgrade in a fully booked hotel.
In all my years of traveling I have never been treated so poorly by a hotel. I never received any follow up from management apologizing or trying to deal with the situation.

id12009,"We booked to stay at the Wilshire Crest in April ---- for - nights.
We needed somewhere that was a moderate price and in a decent location with good parking facilities for our hire car.
We chose the Wilshire Crest Hotel because we thought it was all those things (apart from the parking), we didn't exactly think we'd be staying at the Ritz but we expected a bit of a higher standard of hotel for the money we paid than we ultimate got at the Wilshere Crest Hotel.
On first appearances the hotel looks decent enough, tucked away into a residential suburb near the Wilshire Boulevard and The Grove Shopping Centre. 
But as soon as we got there I knew even my modest hopes of getting a semi-decent hotel for our stay in LA was dashed.
The hotel itself looks very nice from the outside but once you get in the whole hotel feels a bit rundown. The stairs upto the First Floor are a bit rickety and old with a very badly sun-damaged carpet.
The corridoor where the rooms are isn't that bad but is depressingly bland.
Then the rooms themselves, where do I start?
The walls are pretty thin, so you could hear things that maybe you didn't want to hear going on in the adjacent rooms. They're poorly lit and look like a depressing Motel room out of a movie, the sheets were adorned with numerous stains and cigarette burns which complimented the numerous stains on the walls and curtains.
When we first went into the room there was hair in the Sink, and the toilet roll holder-soap holder in the bath-shower unit was rusty. This once again complimented the creaky taps and the small toilet in the tiny bathroom that the hotel supplied.
Then we get to the breakfast. It was a travesty, It is a buffet where you're left to yourself to take as many Bagels-pastries as you want. It basically consisted of Bagels, cereal, tea-coffee, milk, some danish pastries and cake. Then there was this salad stuff that I saw no-one eat on my stay to compliment to 'delicious' bagels and pastries.
I'm not ---% but pretty sure that they didn't put out fresh pastries-cakes every day and that the salad stuff was left out overnight. On more than - occasion I bit into a pastry and it was rock solid. and that's pretty much it, if you don't like Bagels or get fed up with having them everyday then it is terrible.
As for drinks you get orange juice, milk, tea or coffee and that's about it, all served in polystyrene cups.
The two plus points of the hotel were the parking permit you get which enables you to park anywhere in the adjacent roads aslong as you display the permit on your rear-view mirror. We had no problem parking the car and found the fact we didn't have to pay for parking, and the area to park the car is a very safe residential neighbourhood where you didn't have to worry about leaving your car overnight.
And the other was the Television, you get a very extensive Time Warner Cable TV box that includes all the LA sports teams, films, news channels etc. you could ever want.
So to summarise. We made a huge mistake by staying here, and I can confidently say that if we go to LA again we definitely won't be staying at the Wilshire Crest Hotel.

I checked in Sunday night at midnight after spending the day traveling from London. I was exhausted. I was given ---- and was (un)pleasantly greeted with a collapsing bathroom ceiling and peeling paint. If I was staying in a $---night hotel in Chinatown I might reasonably have expected this. But the Radisson Lex is no $---night hotel -- It's a $----night -.- star business hotel. Because of the bathroom situation, you'd assume it'd be easy to switch rooms. As it turned out, it was a huge hassle and with nothing happening until I raised holy hell. 
My frustration with problem: The house keeping staff was seemingly visually impaired to no notice a collapsing ceiling. A customer can check in at midnight but cannot, at -pm, switch to a room with an un-collapsed ceiling. A collapsed bathroom ceiling isn't a strong enough reason to immediately switch rooms as every time I had time to switch the front desk had another excuse why they couldn't accommodate. 
I tried for - days to switch my room. It took a scathing email to get it done. When the problem rose to the attention of the manager (Kerman Lalkaka), he promptly fixed it. He put me in a much better room (----) with an offer of a suite once the US Open finished. I didn't take him up on that offer as I was busy with work and being upgraded to a room with a couch wasn't particually important but it was a really nice gesture on his-the hotels part. 
Over all:
Positives
-. Comfy Beds
-. Enough Elevator Capacity (Anyone who has stayed in NYC hotels understands the luxury of not waiting - or - minutes for an elevator)
-. Good windows - They largely kept out Manhattan's street noise -- AND -- they opened! 
-. Free internet in the Lobby -- Fast paid internet upstairs
Minus
-. Rooms were pretty dated some bordering on decrepit. Flaking paint here and there... Bits of rust on the bathroom mirror frames... The particle board furniture from the --s at the very end of its usable life... The rooms are definitely on the out edge of barely acceptable.
-. House Keeping didn't clean the room - of the days. (this was in addition to the two days where the hurricane had the hotel running on reduced staff)
-. Cheap soap (you notice these things after - weeks)
-. Local calls are charged at -- cents a minute. It was actually cheaper to use my British blackberry to make calls. 
None of the minus were that big of a deal but my - week stay cost $----. No small sum for flaking paint, cheap soap, and collapsing ceilings.

id12095,"This hotel has its good and bad points, but if you are looking for something a little unusual or quirky this could be for you.
I had this hotel booked for me by the company I was visiting and having read a number of reviews on this hotel which were pretty mixed I was concerned at what I would find. 
The room: I had a deluxe 'city scape' view which was a resonable size and overlooked the entrance to the hotel. The room itself was clean the bed comfortable but for me personally the decor was not what you would expect in a city hotel. Although nothing wrong with it the slick modern bathroom did not match the log cabin and cuddly toy approach in the main room. 
The restaurant: The restaurant (bar and lounge) overlook the water and when eating in the restaurant the view is a fabulous place to watch the ships and seals. The dinner menu itself I was not so impressed with. I ate once in the restaurant and struggled to work out what was being described (that could be down to me being English and not familiar with the terms) The food I did have was however very good but I didn't return as it is of a higher class of food and far to fancy to eat regularly. Breakfast has a good choice of foods with a good continental option - but be prepared to wait to be seated! The service is not as efficient as in the evening...
Room service: efficient, tasty food - my only complaint is that there is not anything light like a sandwich on the menu, --% tip plus $- charge is added for each order.
Hotel in general: I have encountered more friendly and efficient staff in other Seattle hotels - they are not bad but I felt at times I was an inconvenince to them. The general decor and facilities are good however the corridors upstairs are in desperate need of a revamp - the carpets are tired the mustard paintwork makes them look worse than perhaps they are. The woodwork is chipped and battered in places and so this is probably the worst area. The business 'suite' is a small cupboard in which you do not want to spend too much time - there is a gym which from what I could see was very busy but not used by myself. 
Location: fabulously placed on the waterfront , however slightly out of town if you like walking - although they do offer a suttle bus to in to town. The cruise ships are right next door so you dont want a room overlooking that as all you see is the side of the cruise ship. The rail tracks do run close to the hotel but I had no trouble with the noise that some had reported - maybe just luck or that I am used to train noise.
Overview: I would not be unhappy to stay here again although would probably select other hotels in Seattle over this one. It is clean and comfortable and the waterfront views are definately its best feature.",Firefox,Mobile,not happy

First, the hot water in the shower didn't work well. I turned it all the way up but it didn't actually get hot until --- of the way into the shower.

In the process, I noticed two cans of macadamia nuts in there that had not been moved (you get charged once you move something), but the tops had been peeled off. I assume this was the last person's attempt to eat things from the refrigerator without being charged. Wouldn't the cleaning staff notice this and remove them and re-stock? I was charged for these two items that I didn't eat. I was able to rectify it, but it meant another phone call. Finally, there were issues with the printer in the very small business center. It meant that I got charged multiple times for a print jobs that I didn't make. But there was no one there to help with the printer, and there was no one who could help with the multiple charges.

id12174,"Honestly, I'm not sure that I would stay here again. I did win this hotel through a Priceline bid and so there really isn't too much that I can complain about. However, if I had paid full price for this hotel you can bet the tone of this review would be different. For the - nights that we were at the hotel we don't remember a single time when the hotel felt quiet or peaceful. We somewhat anticipated the bustle of the hotel simply because it is downtown in Union Square but we did not anticipate on several occasions there being a - minute wait just to use the elevators to get up to our room. It was crowded... and then some. We were on the --th floor and actually had little issue with noise apart from the occasional loud voice in the hall. We had little encounters with anyone who worked at the hotel (apart from check in and check out). The rooms are tiny and the bathroom is microscopic. The bed was so so... but the curtains would black out the room in case you wanted to sleep in (which we did). 
Tip: When you arrive at the front with your baggage you can walk to the left and curve around to the elevators to avoid having to carry all your baggage up the very large set of stairs when you first walk in. We did not know this and carried our heavy bags up all those stairs... which was not fun. Don't expect much help with your bags unless you ask for it.

one of the rooms i stayed in.
I had booked for a twin room ( - beds ) as i was staying with my brother, and even reminded the lady at checkin too, when she gave us our room number and key, and we opened the door to our room there was a small looking room, with - queen bed in it... 
After fixing up the mess, we were given another room with - dbl beds, which was the most important thing to us.
I hope that the renovated part of the hotel looks great, cause the rest of the hotel is nothing to write home about. 
The location is great though, right across the road from Union Square... that's where the hop on hop off bus goes from, and also macy's and a few other department stores are right across the road too.

After calling down to the desk and requesting the change, they managed to find a room with a queen for us, however our room keys did not work, so we had to visit the front desk a THIRD time for working keys. The room was extremely small, which wouldn't have mattered except that the TV was off to the side of the bed, and only one side of the bed could view it past the wall. 
The room was stifling hot when we entered, so we turned the air conditioning on and it eventually cooled off enough for us to fall asleep. However, we awoke at - am suffocating in heat and we could not get our unit to produce any cooler air. The front desk so helpfully told us our unit must be broken and our only option was to sleep with the window open. Several issues with that were that it's downtown Philadelphia and there was no screen, so not only is that not safe but we had mosquitos flying around the room in no time and me with the welts to prove it. The staff so helpfully brought up a fan for us to use, that must have been sitting in storage for a LONG time because it was covered in dust that began blowing around in chunks when we turned it on. At this point, it became hilarious how awful this stay was. In the morning, they went to check us out at the kiosk and I stated that I wanted them to know that our night was miserable, and found it hard to believe they could charge us full price for a stay like that.

He became an “In Touch” member of the hotels and anytime he or I are traveling he looks for a Kimpton. We spent a day in NY city for my birthday and he treated me to a stay at the Kimpton. They treated us in a very welcoming manner and sent up a card individually signed by staff members, cupcakes and champagne in honor of my birthday. When my honey found out that I was going to Philadelphia on business he wanted me to get some pampering before I came back and surprised me with an all expense paid stay at the hotel Palomar. The facility was nicer than the one in NY but the customer service was absolutely not the same. Three of the first five people I met were unwelcoming. I arrived at about -:--pm or a little later. The person that checked me in did not tell me any of the things that were included in my stay.

When my honey made the reservation he spent some time giving the staff instructions that this was a special treat and all charges would go on his tab. He asked that they let me know that I could have an in room massage and I did not know about it until I was almost checked out. When I checked out the woman who attended me was apparently the one who spoke to my honey and made the reservation. She asked if I enjoyed my massage and I told her that I did not have it. She said that she had put a long note and instructions in when she made the reservation and could not believe that the person who checked me in did not say anything. I had dinner at Square ---- the night I arrived. My initial encounter there was not welcoming. I first was greeted by a male host who was distant and informed me that I would have to wait -- minutes for a table. Shortly after a woman took over. She was much more affable and she had me seated within five minutes. The food was fabulous! I had a petite salad for an appetizer which was the most absolutely fresh salad of greens, green beans, grape tomatoes and julienned carrots with a delicious sherry honey vinaigrette. For dinner I had Yellow Fin Tuna which was served with delicious collard greens seasoned with a hint of vinegar, ginger and horseradish all served atop creamy mashed potatoes. My waitress Liz unfortunately was terribly inattentive. She did not really go over the menu, any specials or make any recommendations when I placed my order. She barely came over to my table while I was there. There was a long hiatus from appetizer to dinner ----- minutes and my waitress never came over to say anything.

id12404,"I really wanted to like this hotel. It is in a great location for me and the price was reasonable. My room was decent, it looked to be updated within the past year or so. It was much nicer than I was expecting. A little small but size was really OK for NY. However, I had a very difficult time getting hot water, thus the bad rating.
I came to NY for a cooking class so when I got back to my room at --:-- pm I was filthy and covered with grease. Definitely looking forward to a shower. I ran the shower for -- minutes and got no hot water so I called the desk. An engineer was sent up to my room and confirmed no hot water. He did make a flippant comment though… “It’s the summer anyway, you don’t really need hot water, do you?” Uuhh, yes!
I called down to the front desk again. This time I was told that nobody else had called and it must be just my floor. He didn’t offer me a room on another floor where I would supposedly find hot water. He said they would “re-set” the system and in -- minutes I should have hot water.
Well no hot water was available after -- more minutes so I went to bed unhappy. I had a hard time sleeping. When I got up around -:--am, there was hot water. When I came back at --:--am there was none. When I checked out I complained…they do have a “guarantee”. The manager told me that yes, sometimes the boiler is turned off in the summer. But kept waffling about the details. Maybe it is “accidentally” turned off. I couldn’t quite get an answer with him going in circles trying hard not make good on their promise to not charge for an unpleasant stay.
The impression I got was that hot water is available only during certain peak hours. So if you only want hot water during these hours then I could recommend the hotel. A hot shower available ---- is important to me especially during the summer when I am walking around in hot humid weather. So unfortunately I will not be returning.

id12417,"I spent two nights at the Eldon in mid-December, ----. I had gotten a good price online ($--- the first night, $--- the second) and was attracted by the kitchen amenities and the location as well as positive reviews.
The location is very convenient -- a short walk from the Mt. Vernon Square Metro stop, right on the Yellow Line (and thus a very quick train ride from Reagan National Airport). You'll walk past a few derelict buildings on your way, but it's actually not a bad neighborhood, and if you have a meeting in the convention center it's an absolutely ideal location. The only downside is that there aren't many restaurants nearby.
Another plus: free, no-hassle WiFi.
I was checked in quickly and politely and went up to my room on the -th floor. The decorating theme in the hotel is a bit strange -- my floor featured a floor-to-ceiling depiction of an odalisk at one end, which is a first for me in my hotel experience -- but what's really weird is that the floors in the rooms (or in mine anyway) are completely tiled. In the summertime, this is probably a plus, since DC is notoriously hot and humid in the summer. In the winter, it wasn't so much a plus. The room felt cold and clinical rather than homey and inviting. However, it was very clean and the kitchen was fully equipped, there were lots of closets, the hotel provides robes and slippers, and the bed was exceptionally comfortable. What the rest of the room lacked in warmth and softness was made up for by a very comfortable mattress, feather comforter, and feather pillows. (What added to the weird coldness, in my case, was the fact that I never saw another guest there during my stay -- I swear I was the only guest on the fourth floor. That may be a testament to the hotel's exceptional soundproofing, or it may be that I was just staying there during a lull in business, but it did increase the generally cold, lonely feeling I got while I was there.)

After staying in many - and - star hotels from Starwood I was surprised on the widespread low quality of this hotel. I like modern and chick quality hotels with excellent service, but sadly this is not one of them.
Rooms: Furnishings are really low quality. You get fancy looking bed furniture made of cheap clear acrylic plastic. The walls look like are made of plastic. The closet is just - pieces of plywood put together standing in the entrance of the room, it is not even bolted to the wall and can fall over. The safe did not work properly. The bathroom door was a pain to close. Floor is made of cheap ceramic tiles. In general the room looks very modern and chick but if feels like it was put together by a teenage girl after going to home depot and wallmart.
Room service: Whatever Whenever? There is no dining room service from --:-- AM to -:--PM on a - star hotel, category - according to Starwood. I tried to order a sandwich and I was told to go to the lobby and order it myself and take it to my room. There are - star hotels with room service at this hours.
Bell Boys: They never even offered to carry my bags when I arrived. I had to carry them from the entrance to the -th floor lobby, then to my room. Same thing at checkout, I even had to help a poor girl trying to open a door with huge bags while the doorman and bellboys where standing - feet away.
Doorman taxi friends: While leaving and waiting for a taxi along with several people, the doorman asked where I was going, as soon as he knew I was going to NWK he directed me to a taxi around -- steps in front of the hotel. He greeted the cab driver, chatted for a minute (they knew each other) and then we were off. Mid way I noticed the meter was off, big mistake on my part. I was charged whatever the cab driver wanted and had to pay cash. Looking back it was definitely planned by the doorman to help his friend; I won’t go in full details now.
Acoustics:. The acoustics of the room are not good. I could hear and understand what the housekeepers were talking about all morning. The double glass windows do a fair job at decreasing the times square noise. 
Housekeeping: There was an already opened water bottle in the minibar which I had to pay. The consumed items in the minibar were never replaced in the whole stay. The towels smell like burnt plastic, a very strange unpleasant smell.
Conclusion: This is really a - star hotel. There are much better hotels in NYC and in Times Square if you care about location. To me it seems like the W Times Square doesn’t really care since most customers are single time tourists or wannabes. I also think this is why it has so many “good” reviews on this site.

id12422,"I stayed at the Hotel Abri in September, for one night and then later in the same week for two further nights. 
Positively the rooms are clean, and the staff were amazingly friendly with very good service. Also the hotel has a business area with two PC's and a printer that you can use for free- very handy for online check in for flights etc.
Negatively the rooms are very small and on the first night we were awoken by noise from the street. Although we mentioned this to the staff and asked if we could have a quieter room when we returned in a few days and as a result got a free upgrade to a -th floor executive room, which was larger and quieter.
Also the hotel is located in Union Sq, SF's main shopping area. This is a central location but personally after having explored SF I would have rathered stayed in some other areas, such as Nob Hill. Union Sq is busy, noisy and a little bit dodgy- lots of homeless people and just a few blocks in the worng direction from the hotel you end up in the Tenderloin which is SF's worst area for crime- I ended up having to visit the police station there after being pickpocketed on my way from the airport to the hotel! 
And one small gripe- we payed for bed and breakfast. The breakfast is provided by a restaurant next door to the hotel, and the set offer is for an american breakfast. I don't eat eggs or pork (which is basically what an american breakfast is) and asked if I could change to granola (which is $- cheaper on the restaurants menu) and they refused as this was outside of the set deal that they have with the hotel. As I said, a small gripe but it just annoyed me.

The bartender has been the same person serving me for the last - years, I believe...maybe longer. I have never been there on his day off or when he is on vacation, apparently. He is also very friendly and a good bartender. It can get busy in the small lounge though and I wish they would have someone that could jump back there and help him out from time to time.
The internet is fine in the rooms, it's free in the lobby--but not many seats in the lobby. For the price, it's a decent value. I did use the hot tub for the first time on my last stay. It was warm, but the seats are really low so I had to almost sit on my knees to stay about the water (and I'm -'-, not tall but not short either).

The hot tub is kind of """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""around the corner"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" from the pool so hidden a little bit....that is nice, except when parents let their kids in the hot tub and don't get off their bums in their chairs by the pool to make sure the kids are OK...But I digress, lol...that is not the hotel's fault!. There is both an indoor and outdoor pool. I haven't used them and really just recently found them....
I have eaten the food in the lounge, same normal fair for a hotel restaurant. I've never had breakfast there.

When my husband called the front desk after hearing about my ordeal, he got the sarcastic reply from Mark Lambert, “well, we ARE in a desert.” No, we’re at the BILTMORE and not camping on the desert floor. BTW Mark should not be in a customer facing job–he’s way too arrogant. They comp’d us the room and we moved to cottage K, which they ‘said’ they sprayed for bugs-scorpions. Cottage is about -- yrs old and shows it. Dingy. No safety runner or handles in the marble floored, small, dark shower stall – what a safety hazard and lawsuit waiting to happen. Dark lighting everywhere. Dead bugs lying in the ceiling light covers. (hey, but no scorpions, aren’t we lucky!) A-C that barely spit out cold air, except after -pm at night. No storage space for clothing. - of - small drawers was dedicated to mini bar liquor and snacks (overpriced) and the fridge was loaded with beverages and booze–no room for a water bottle. One restaurant was closed for remodeling and the Wright restaurant had a severly limited menu of choices that were overpriced. We went out a few nights just to get decent food choices. The Starbucks Café was another place to get food, but you paid dearly for items, such as coffee and bagel with cream cheese, and options limited. I know we’re on a resort but do we have to feel like prisoners? Give us food choices, vending machines and soda machines too for heaven’s sake. This place is sooooo overpriced and not worth the $----night. The one day the housekeeper left our patio door WIDE open. Thank God our computer and valuables weren’t stolen! I went to the salon to get a champagne pedicure, $--. It was nothing special nor what you’d expect from a famous “resort and spa.” Very average service. I get more at my local salons, even a mimosa or glass of cheap champagne – nothing at the Biltmore spa though – just some iced tea. They may think the name will make people shell out tons of cash, but they’re wrong. We’ve been to the nicest places here and abroad and to the not so nice places, so we come with some experiences and knowledge. The AZ Biltmore is a loser–don’t bother staying there.

There was a small balcony that you could sit on. In our case, we had a beautiful view of the airport to enjoy. You coul definitely hear them taking off every few minutes if the door was open. If the balcony door was closed, it was very hard to hear the planes. Room service pricing was reasonable, food was average.
Our room was clean and comfortable. The Bay Tower has a small gift shop, medium sized restaurant (seemed to be dinner only), and conference rooms. The lobby was not welcoming, and if you didn't order room serrvice, then you are a hungry person. You can hike over to the Marina Tower, which definitiely has a nicer lobby. On the way to the Marina Tower, you will pass a small coffee shop with sandwiches and muffins (if you need a quick bite and dont want to hike all the way to the other tower). The Marina Tower lobby has a restaurant, sports bar, gift shop, wireless area and lounge. This lobby is decently appointed (much better than the bay tower). You can rent boats and seadoos just outside the marina tower.
Overall, this is a decent hotel if you are looking for a relaxing trip, and the room is just to sleep or hang out in. I would recommend the marina tower for the lobby and its facilities over the bay tower, although i hear the rooms are smaller in the marina tower.

The rooms have all the basics you need, but it's not a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""warm"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" place at all - literally. The windows don't seal and it's very drafty. Because it's a renovated a warehouse everything is cement with thin squares of carpet strategically placed. It's known as a place that can be rented for raves, and the cement structure sends the vibrations from the basement party room throughout the entire building; sleeping on those nights is difficult. One evening the bar area had been rented for a private party so the hotel guests had very limited access. The bar staff were very good, but it's rude to be told we couldn't sit at the bar when we're staying at the place. We arrived one night to a valet attendant insisting he had to park our car even though we were hotel guests with a parking pass. The manager on duty, a lovely young lady who had helped us with other things, went with us to chat with the valet attendant. He reluctantly acquiesced, but seemed miffed that he should have to take orders from a woman and was surly to us when we returned to our car later.

id12588,"The Watermark, now almost - years old, made the top -- in the recent Conde Nast Traveler Reader’s Choice Awards for US hotels. The hotel’s website claims that San Antonio now has a “world-class hotel and spa.” Well…not quite. 
I have stayed at all kinds of hotels, and have had wonderful experiences at both modest and not-so-modest properties. I am not a high-maintenance traveler. My expectations are commensurate with the hotel category and the location (US vs. Europe or Asia, for instance). Given the cost ($---) per night and the glowing reviews, I had high hopes for the Watermark. What I found was a beautiful hotel with spotty service from a sometimes unseasoned staff.
Check in time is -:--. Upon arrival at -:--, I was told my room would not be ready until -:--. I expressed displeasure with this and was told that the hotel had contracted a “late departure” of -:-- that day for a large group and that there were no rooms available. I found this an unsatisfactory situation and explanation, and asked to speak to a manager; one of the other staff members at the front desk simply stepped forward and reiterated what had just been said. There was no attempt made to remedy this situation in any way at this time. A room was available an hour later. As I scrambled to get ready for a dinner reservation, I called down to see if I might borrow an umbrella but was told none were available (not sure why; not raining heavily and the hotel certainly was no longer close to full at that point). The next day, I asked to speak to the general manager. He was apparently busy that day and farmed out my call to the “rooms manager” which was fine. The rooms manager sincerely apologized for the problem, and offered to comp me any spa services which was a nice gesture. Arrangements were also made for the hotel’s car to be made available to take me to the airport on my departure. Later that day I also received a typed apology from the front desk manager from the previous night, and a fruit plate.
The room was lovely: high ceilings, well-appointed, with a large marble bathroom with Jacuzzi and separate shower. The shower head’s water pressure was the best I have ever experienced…anywhere. The in-house toiletries were only OK. The bed and linens were fine with lots of pillows but not memorable. Turndown service was a nice touch, but the daily housekeeping tended to occur on the late side (mid-late afternoon on each of the - days I was there) so it seemed like there were frequent housekeeping visits clumped into the span of a few hours at the end of the day. There was no view to speak of. I had hoped for free internet access but this was not the case. I did not eat at the restaurant, Pesca, and did not have room service. 
All in all, I left feeling favorably about this hotel. Everyone was polite. The room was very comfortable. I guess I was disappointed with the check-in process, and that I had to make a formal complaint (first time for me), but they did try to make amends. Upon reading the other Tripadvisor reviews, I see that this problem (late check-in) has happened at least once before me. Anticipating guests’ needs goes a lot further than automatically saying “Ms.-Mr…” in every interaction. It’s a lovely property, and with a more attention to detail, a stay at the Watermark could be quite a memorable experience.",Firefox,Mobile,not happy

id12608,"The Indigo was a disappointment for me. The front desk staff were not rude (by NYC standards) but neither were they friendly or welcoming. No smiles, minimal eye contact. Not a great start. The pair of guys at the front desk were either having a bad day or just in the wrong job. 
Parking is on the next block. The Indigo has a deal with a parking company to offer its guests a tiny discount. The garage gives you a ticket and the front desk will validate the ticket. Overnight parking costs just under $-- with tax, even with the 'discount'.
There is construction in the adjacent lot which means parking on the same side of the street is restricted. There is no designated hotel parking zone in front of the Indigo, plus there is a fire hydrant a few yards from the entrance, so it is not really even easy to pull over and leave your bags and then go park your car. There was no valet, bellman or any other assistance offered with bags or parking. Other hotels handle this better with signage and valet service.
The location of the hotel in relation to places you might want to visit is pretty good. However, the particular street where the hotel is located is below average for the area. There was a significant amount of trash piled up along both sides of the street and mainly commercial vans and trucks during the day. The street is mainly made up of florists which is sort of interesting but at night, everything is shuttered and the street is a little unpleasant. Adjacent streets are also a little sketchy and there is no evidence of the art scene that you might expect for Chelsea. There is none of the character and charm that you might find in other parts of Chelsea or in the West Village.
The location is something of a gamble for the Indigo. They have obviously decided to build a wannabe-boutique hotel in a pretty low-rent street in the hope the the area will become gentrified. However, the Indigo has been here for a while and the street still looks shabby. Locals would probably consider the Indigo to be in the middle of nowhere - which is slightly unfair given it's proximity to main attractions - but other, better hotels are closer.
The rooftop bar is fine but - as another poster has mentioned - attracts the ---something cocktail crowd. That's fine but there's no obvious place for adult hotel guests to hang out - the lobby is tiny. I don't want to be around a bunch of hotel lobby drunks as I come in and out of my hotel and this is the result of putting a destination bar at the top of a small hotel.
The room was kind of a mixed bag. It is designed to be cool and trendy, and to a point, it is. But there was no attention to detail - the little things that make a $--- room seem worth it. The walls were scuffed, hotel stationery tatty and the laminate flooring made a nice change from carpet but didn't seem very clean. The bathroom was nice though and the basic level of finish was okay - but for the price - there was nothing impressive about this room. In fairness, it wasn't as tiny as some rooms I have stayed in in New York hotels.
The most positive thing I can say is that the maid was very friendly as I left - """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""have a happiness day!"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" she said.

id12632,"I have recently stayed at the Savoy Suites... and had some serious questions as to why it has such a high ranking amongst hotels in Washington DC. There are some perks, but other than that... you can do better! 
The hotel is not in Georgetown, but rather in Glover Park. It is a brisk -- minute walk to M street and all that is Georgetown. It is, however, in close proximity to a nice selection of restaurants and bars. A Whole Foods and CVS is just a minute away. There is free parking which is unusual for DC hotels, and complimentary wifi in the room. 
The rooms have been cheaply renovated, but not modernized. The only modernization is the bathroom which recently been redone... Still, a - star rating would be a stretch. The worn out wall paper and art on the walls as well as the dated and bulky furniture tells its own story. The towels are not in the best of shape, nor is the cleanliness of the bathroom. 
So after my experience I questioned how this could be one of the top hotels in DC. Certainly not the staff... certainly not the facilties... certainly not the rooms... so I dug further.
Come to find out... much of the BRAVISIMO mantra coming from this hotel is not sincere. If you read the reviews, you will see that most are responded from someone named MarcAnthony Crimi. Who identified himself in more than one review as a manager of the Savoy Suites. If you look deeper on tripadvisor, you also see that this person is a manager at the Carlyle Suites in DC as well as a hotel in Manhattan. This person does exist, but I think things come into prospective when I tell you that he is not even employed by the hotel. A quick google search and I found that he is indeed employed by STRATEGIC HOTEL MARKETING. BASED IN NEW YORK! So the Welcome he plans to give you in DC... ummmm... not so much. 
So it is VERY VERY insincere that that a person who is a web marketer pretend to be the manager of a hotel and address and respond to the customer issues.

The front desk personnel were very nice. The location is convenient, within walking distance to the wharf, chinatown, the cable cars, lombard street, etc. Some of the hills can be a challenge though depending upon which way you go. The free parking is an awesome deal, considering most places charge about $-- - $-- for parking. The parking area was kind of tight, and I felt my vehicle was safe.

On top of this, the fire alarm continued to go off intermitantly for the next five hours. No communication from the staff at the hotel until there was a near riot in the foyer.

id12670,"There is no hotel with a more beautiful lobby or a more august history than the Palmer House Hilton in Chicago. However, guests don't sleep in the lobby, and heritage is no substitute for customer service. From the moment my wife and I arrived, we were made to feel as if the Palmer House Hilton was doing us a big, fat favor by letting us stay there. The doormen and bellmen ignored us, and the desk clerks were indifferent about serving us.

Our room was literally as far away from all of this as possible which would not have been a problem but when staying for - nights it would have been nice to be closer to the facilities for meals, drinks etc. 
On check in we were surprised to be given vouchers for a buffet continental breakfast which turned out to be disappointing, only offering stale croissants and a sparse selection of fruit, not even toast. On one occasion we forgot our vouchers and the women at the restaurant advised us we would need them for breakfast, again not a problem usually but to get back to the room and get them would be a good - minute round trip, not ideal when pressed for time She could surely have checked the computer system to check we were guests. We skipped breakfast that morning and ordered a cooked breakfast the next.
The hotel offered a free shuttle to local attractions, beware they do not go to the Safari Park, you will need to seek alternate arrangments to get there. We booked this with Grayline who told us the wrong pick up time and left us out in the rain waiting for a pick up that arrived an hour earlier.
The room was a comfortable size, the bathroom is a bit on the small side.
The location of the hotel is out of walking distance from the Gaslamp area of town so unless you have a car you will need to cab or bus to get to a great selection of restaurants. Due to this we ate in the restaurant a few nights, the meals ok value but limited selection compared with other restaurants around.
We could rate highly enough the service of Michael at the concierge desk, he went out of his way to assist and was extremely helpful.

id12676,"Months prior to my --night reservation with the Hilton Chicago I requested a room that allowed in a lot of natural light, facing an open view, not a close building. (The reservation was made through a conference travel agency.) I confirmed my request by telephone a few days in advance directly with the hotel and at check-in the clerk noted it in my record. She told me it would be difficult to find, but consulted a chart and appeared to be satisfied with the room she assigned me. I was very surprised to open the door onto a room on the inside of one of the towers, tucked into a very dark corner, facing a wall of rooms. I called the desk immediately and was told that the hotel was sold out and it was hard to tell what rooms were still available that suited my request, but to “sit tight” and someone would call me. No one did. Further calls yielded similar results. At one point I was told I could have a “parlor room,” with a sofa bed, at a reduced rate, but I could not go see the room before committing to moving. That’s real hospitality for you. Worried that a bad sofa bed could be worse than rooming in a cave, I ended up staying in the dreadfully dark room. (I had asked for a bright room with one bed and got a dark room with two beds.) The only redeeming feature of the room was that it had - bathrooms. Other than that, it was tight quarters with a tiny closet, two uncomfortably low chairs, at the desk and in a (dark) corner. Light fixtures didn’t do much to brighten things up. Since I was here at a conference, I really wanted a bright environment to wake up early and start the workday in and to have as a cheerful office for mid-day calls and e-mail, but instead I got a cave. Consequently, I spent as little time as possible in the room and next time I am in Chicago, conference or not, I will absolutely stay at another hotel. There are much better locations that the Hilton Chicago and looking at the percentage of “inside tower” rooms, places with a much better chance of having a bright room as well as better customer service.

Well the catch is that the club lounge is only open for breakfast Monday - Friday, and hors d'oeuvres Sunday to Thursday. which is not listed in any of the communications or links I was sent from Starwood and the hotel. It is mentioned on the Features & Activities page of the hotel website. But I was not told of this when I booked or when I checked in.
I contacted the front desk and was told the Club lounge was not open on weekends, but that I was still entitled to the other benefits of free internet, car parking and the bottle (single) of water in my room.
I contacted SPG chat and after a lengthy online chat with Amy was told pretty much the same thing, sorry but there is nothing we are going to do or offer you, its listed on the website.
The hotel is fine room wise, good bed, a little dated decor, room compendium stained and damaged pages, good Air Conditioning, happy looking staff, but I think for the money I could have got a better deal at the other hotels down the road which were including a full breakfast with the room rate.
I was not satisfied with the response I received from the initial contact with hotel staff or from SPG online Chat, I believe their upgrade information is misleading and they kept trying to pass the blame.
While writing this review I received a call from Lucy at the front desk apologising and sending me up vouchers for Continental Breakfast which is all I really wanted in the first place, but I had to jump through hoops to get to this point and spend an hour and a half of my time dealing with it.
There are promotions everywhere saying """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Rediscover Sheraton"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" well Sheraton needs to rediscover its guests and its communications to ensure that all information is clear and concise and clearly stated. 
In the old days (-- yrs ago) every effort would be made to resolve an issue and associates were empowered to take the initiative and ask the guest what they wanted for the problem to be solved. On my experience this time no one asked me what it would take to make me a happy and satisfied guest, they pointed me to the web page and said its there to read that lounge is closed. They did not put themselves into my shoes to see how I was feeling and I don't think realised that a tiny little thing like a continental breakfast would impact on view and opinion of the Sheraton and Starwood brands. I now have a breakfast voucher, but I had to fight for it and spend time that will never be recovered.
I don't know what training programs Sheraton and Starwood use now, but I would recommend that they go back and look at reviewing it and maybe revisit SGSS.",Edge,Desktop,not happy

id12782,"I was thrilled to see that the Joie de VIvre group was opening their first hotel in Chicago, especially in a wonderful neighborhood which didn't have many hotel options before. This location puts you in the middle of Old Town, a beautiful residential neighborhood which has a very vibrant commercial area, full of interesting restaurants and shops. You will be a couple of blocks away from the world-famous Second City comedy club (a must), the Chicago Historical Society museum, and right across from the Lincoln Park Zoo. I lived in Chicago for nearly - decades, so I enjoy going back and staying in an area where I feel like a resident rather than a visitor.
The reason I seek out Joie de Vivre hotels is that they typically offer fun design and good locations without a huge price tag, and the Hotel Lincoln delivers on this. Decor is funky with a retro vibe: not at all your cookie-cutter chain hotel feel, nor is it a --star luxury hotel feel. This is a big city boutique hotel, so it was no surprise that the rooms were on the tight side. The ----'s architecture dictates the space allocation, to a certain extent, which means small rooms, but no smaller than at many other city hotels. The bathrooms have a sliding, rather than a swinging, door because the hallway is too narrow. Cool door, but zero sound privacy. The heating and cooling units below the windows were noisy and not functioning optimally. We stayed there after the hotel had only been open for a few weeks, and management knew there was a problem with this and was working on it.
Our Lakeview Junior Suite was a nice corner on a high floor, which we were given as a free upgrade, perhaps because I'm a member of their loyalty club. I was with my husband and two children, so having TWO full bathrooms in our suite made getting out the door in the mornings much faster. Ask for a room away from the elevator to avoid hearing a very loud ding every time it stops on your floor. Very comfortable king bed, not so comfortable (to be expected) pull-out sofa bed. Room lighting was a bit dim and should be augmented. Room design and colors were interesting, trendy.
The very young staff usually was pleasant and tried to be helpful, although some seemed inexperienced. Although there was a bellhop at the front door, loading and unloading luggage from cars, no one ever offered to bring our luggage to the room. Housekeeping was generally very good, but one night, when we got back to our room, it hadn't been touched. After notifying the desk, we had to wait a while before housekeeping arrived. Second floor business center has big iMacs, but dial-up internet service is very slow. Having a very good coffee bar, Elaine's, off the lobby was much appreciated.
Would I stay here again? Yes. When I want to be in a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""real"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" neighborhood, not in the middle of downtown or a tourist area, but still having plenty of action nearby, Hotel Lincoln fits the bill.",Google Chrome,Mobile,not happy
id12784,"I found there were good and not so good aspects to my stay - the hotel.
The Good: The hotel is located in an area close to everything. If you like being in the middle of the action then consider booking here. The free breakfast is a bonus, although you may run into a full dining area and warm (as opposed to hot) food. The building itself is historic, I like that. I pre-requested a mini fridge and got one. The bathroom was a good size. Staff was pleasant.
The Not so Good: My room had a view of a brick wall - alley. Not the fault of Hampton, they can't control the buildings that are built around them. I assume a lot of the views aren't great at this location. My room was sort of small, but not too bad. The wireless internet went in and out for awhile, they fixed the problem but it was a pain. Too bad they didn't knock $-- or so off the bill because of it (I mentioned the problem a couple of times). My room had some noise issues - minor though, just someone either in the room beside me or above me slamming a door. Also, if you don't need - want to be in the middle of all the action then consider something on the outskirts of downtown.
I'd recommend this hotel if you first eliminated some of the other downtown hotels - usually they're priced much higher making the HI a good deal. This hotel had good bang for the buck when I booked it but if I was returning to downtown Indy I'd consider other options but I'd also be willing to stay here again if the price was right.

During our whole stay there (-nights), everynight, someone was screaming at the receptionist all night, from about -am to -am. We could not get any sleep, even with ear plugs! I believe someone was training someone else because we were being trained at the same time, against our will, due to the ARMY-LIKE SHOUTING we have been exposed to.

The bathtub faucet was broken and ready to fall off. It was fairly quiet, so that wasn't a problem. The housekeeping staff quickly fulfilled a request for foam pillows. The pool was heated and easily accessible, however small, so it filled quickly to capacity.

The Iroquois is quite pretty and in an excellent location. The staff was pleasant. Yet, for me, it’s all about the details and no one seems to be setting best practices or minding that existing protocols are followed.
Upon arrival, which unfortunately coincided with the beginning of Superbowl XLIII, I dragged my roller bag up the four steep steps as no doorman was in sight. Naturally, he turned up as I finished my check-in and offered to help me take my bag upstairs in the elevator. I pointed out the irony and he declared that he was the only one on duty that night.
The bedroom looked comfortable, although short on power outlets; but my first observation of the bathroom revealed both hair and stains on the sink – yuck. Attempted to call down to the front desk to request the wifi code and the handset of the cordless phone didn’t work. In the morning, I experienced a clogged tub drain as water pooled to about - inches while I showered and I then found that the light on the make-up mirror (a nice touch) was burned out. I reported all but the soiled sink (which I wiped down myself). The phone and tub were fixed by the next day, but not the make-up mirror. On the second morning, a random extra box of hand soap was left atop the minibar, where it remained despite at least a couple more housekeeping visits. Curiously too, housekeeping seemed compelled to turn one set of blinds up and one set down when closing them at the end of each day. And the decorative bolster pillow, which during the day rested atop the bed pillows, was placed on the floor during turndown – again, yuck.

Im a makeup artist and was doing work all week in a studio very close to there and it was convient for me to get to work and back with no traffic etc. 
Here are the pros and cons 
The Cons first 
The Wifi was avaiable only by code and password that they provide you and if you are online and someone else is using the same online code it will say that is busy? 
The pool never gets sun ( BUT IS VERY CLEAN) 
The parking is limited ( -- units in the building with only - parking spots ) and the neighborhood is PERMIT parking only . 
( however I never had a problem with parking my car but did once when I came back late ( around -pm the lot was full ) which led me to drive around a million times and I had to park in a lot next door and had to quickly move it by -am before I got towed. 
The bathrooms are very very very very very dirty ( the walls have dirty hand prints and the floors are dusty. I cleaned the toliet myself to guarentee a clean seat for me. 
The room REEEEAKED of smoke They have non smoking and smoking rooms and you can smell the smoke straight through the walls even if your room isnt smoking ( this wasnt pleasent at all ) 
THE CONS 
The average hotel for this location is $--- a night I only paid $-- a night!!!
They hotel owner was VERY VERY VERY NICE 
The coffee was always brewed in the morning and he had fresh pastrys that was tasty . 
The A-C worked great , the beds were cozy ( BRING YOUR OWN PILLOWS the pillows they have are flat as a pancake) 
The hotel was equipped with several camera and it seemed very safe. 
There are mircowaves and Refridgerators.
The do clean your rooms for you and make your beds etc when you leave for the day and come back everything looks great.
The showers are clean but as I mentioned before the floors in the bathroom was dirty and the walls were gross looking .

While the location was great, especially if spending time in Center City; for us it was ideal as we were attending an event at the Academy of Music right across the street, the hotel itself was lacking. My husband and I stayed at the hotel for one night, and one night was enough. First, after we parked our car in the deck, the elevator to take us to the hotel, stopped on every floor above us before going back down to the street-lobby level. Quite uncomfortable with no air conditioning in the heat of the summer, as well, when we got off the elevator a worker asked us if we were the folks who were just stuck in the elevator.....Apparently they were not working correctly!
Our room initially appeared clean, until removing a towel from the towel rack in the bathroom, we spotted a cockroach scurrying across the wall and floor (and we were on the -th floor) which means god help the floors below us! We then opted to keep on all the lights and elevate all of our belongings as we did not want to take home any unwanted guests. Sleeping in a room with roaches was not enjoyable, nor was the bed we slept on; it was rather uncomfortable and hard.
After our evening out and returning to the parking deck of the hotel, we realized that now, both elevators were out of service. A small sign depicting this was posted next to, not on the elevator, not the best announcement. We then walked back to the hotels parking deck to realize that the stairs were caution taped off and you could not use those to exit the deck. For a split second I thought perhaps we would be bunking in our car. On the far end of the parking deck, luckily was a second set of stairs which got us back to the hotel.
The next day, after the event and returning to the hotel, I wanted to wash my hands...shaking many hands grosses me out...I went to the public restroom in the hotel bar-lounge where there were two soap dispensers, none of which had soap in them....Ugh....I wondered what soap the staff was using after going to the bathroom and then serving your food. Not good!
That being said, the one saving grace at the Doubletree was the hotel staff. They were polite, accommodating and friendly. They made our uncomfortable stay a bit more enjoyable.

There was a marked difference between the - properties and thats not just size. I was totally thrilled with my stay in Schaumberg and a lot less thrilled with the Hyatt Regency.
Its a huge hotel , as most conference hotels are and I am a disabled guest with impaired mobility . So I travel with my own mobility scooter so I can get around the miles of corridors with no trouble. I booked an accessible room in advance and at check in my only real requirement was a room with a walk in shower.
Only one room was available and it had a Murphy bed . I'm British - I had no idea what that was but as the shower requirment for a long stay was important I took the room.
Hotels - please note.... Its REALLY hard to open or close the room door when you're on a scooter without a door wedge to hold it open. It was my first request when my bags eventually arrived at my room.
My room was a good size, had a great view and had the Murphy Bed. Now ,I know its a fold away bed - maybe not ideal for a disabled guest as it was also very high off the floor. My room also had - chaise lounge , i sofa, a high table and four dining chairs, a sideboard and huge glass coffee table a book shelf, a telelvision and unit, a small table for the coffee machine , a desk and chair ..... I wondered how many guests they thought I might be inviting back to my room!!
My luggage 'got lost'. It travelled nearly ---- miles from the UK without challenge...and they lost it between the forecourt and my room. After - hours and several phone calls...I went off in search of the luggage and spotted it in the holding area staright away! Come on Hyatt !!
I was returning a rental car to the hotel so they took my luggage from the forecourt but then I had to drive the car to the underground garage , unlioad my scooter and travel back up in the luggage elevator, its the only one that serves all - undergound conference floors so I got to know it really well over the next - days.
Bistro --- is NOT disabled accessible as there are stairs on all approaches. the BIG Bar is not disabled accessible as it has stairs at the entrance.
Shame on you Hyatt..... 
My biggest concern about the whole stay though was one that could and should have been simply remedied. There was no light near the bed . So once I turned the lights off I had to navigate the furniture maze and glass coffee table in pitch black to get back to my bed. There are no bedside tables and no lamps within arms reach .
I did tell reception - but like the door wedge nothing happened. I felt invisible not disabled. 
So - in conclusion- This hotel is not ideal for disabled guests but a few small changes would go a long way. The staff were pleasant but sometimes ineffective because if you say you're going to do something , please do it. 
Would I stay again - maybe , its a convenient location . But as a Hyatt Gold card member... I maybe had expectations that were higher than the hotel could live up too.

Upon arrival the lobby area was nice and attractive. The front desk attendants were neither friendly nor rude. I was given my room and sent on my way. The hallways were rather tired with aging carpeting and sporting some stains that were crying out for a rug doctor. 
The room was somewhat clean. The bed featured a comfortable mattress along with high quality sheets and bedding. The tv was rather old and a flat screen would have definitely been appreciated. I did make the mistake of dropping the remote control and seeing the inch tall mountain of dust staring back at me when i looked under the bed. 
The bathroom was ok with a comfortable shower with good water pressure and a steady stream of hot water available. 
Restaurant service is best described as snails-pace. If you're in anything even remotely resembling a hurry i'd have to say go elsewhere. The food quality wasn't bad. 
I too experienced room service trays left for over a day in the hallways. I got so sick of looking at my neighbors decaying breakfast from the day before i took the try back down to the restaurant myself. The hotel appeared to be understaffed in many areas in my opinion.

Just prior to landing, the flight attendant informed me that the connecting flight was also severely delayed and there was a chance I could make my flight (they would honor my original ticket).
Quick – back on the phone to Marriott to cancel my one night in DFW Marriott South and reclaim my Sunday night at the Waterford Marriott OKC. All is well – I thought.
My room at the Waterford Marriott OKC was successfully re-booked and I was told there would not be a charge for the change (very understanding of the weather in the mid-west). However, the cancellation was never sent to the DFW Marriott South hotel. As my hands were full of luggage as I ran between terminals, I did not record my cancellation number.
Now the true insult begins. I contacted the DFW Marriott South and explained the situation. Being a -- year road warrior and veteran of Marriott hotels, surely they could work with me regarding this room charge. The General Manager (Jeremy [--]) must have felt my brand loyalty had no value, as he did not return either of my phone calls. Instead he relayed his denial though one of his staff.

But the biggest disappointment was the attitude of staff on reception. With only one exception (Mohammed) they were completely lacking in courtesy and very, very unhelpful. There was no offering of information about the surrounding area, no map offered, no information about the hotel - not even the time of breakfast - and the person on checkout was just plain rude. I was both surprised and disappointed - my experience of other hotels in the US is exactly the opposite and this is supposedly one of New York's best hotels.

A strong -.
While there is absolutely nothing wrong with the very friendly and attentive service the hotel provides and the location of the very same, i do have a problem with slow internet and uncomfortable beds. 
The bed is rather hard and the pillows just disintegrate once you lay your head upon them. The A-C is also disturbing at night time as it blows directly on you in bed + makes a clicking sound every few seconds.
There were also some glitches in the service that affected the rating in a negative fashion.
Location:
A - minute walk (in leisurely tempo) from Times square AND -th Avenue. So not far away from great shopping or the theatres + an easy distance from Central Park so extremely well situated IMO. 
Room:
We had - connecting rooms, - suite (----) and one king bedroom(----). I really liked their system of closing a door in the main corridor, creating a large hallway, so that one can go back and forth in between the - rooms without having to use the keys. Also, if this is the solution you would like to go for, please do note that the highest floor you can have is the --th. But the views are more than ok anyways! The décor is nothign special. Feels new enough, but is very discreet.
Also these rooms are at the end of the hotel so i do imagine that they are maybe a bit quieter than other rooms.
Pro´s:
* It is not noisy at all from the street or from other rooms
* The rooms are large by NYC city hotel room standards!! 
* Big bathtub (----) and large freestanding shower (----). Regular sized tub and freestanding shower in ----
* Great water pressure and heat
* Hèrmes amenities which are divine
* Good views
* Really good storage space for both clothes and toiletries
* The room becomes very dark
* It is very clean!
Con´s:
* The bed and pillows are not comfortable and the bedlinen merely just more than ok.
 * The A-C is placed in a silly place so it blows directly at you when you lay in bed and makes clicking sounds every few seconds .
* Rather odd labyrinthesque layout
* Internet is beyond slow at times, very un-even speeds
Staff-Service:
Very pleasant and providing good service in every department in general. 
Their concierges (Vladimir in particular!) is utmost helpful and great with helping out with everything from renting a specific car, suggesting ticket reservations to finding rare garments. 
Food:
Breakfast was good, but on the expensive side. Service a tad slow and in-accurate ie brought things not ordered.
Only had dinner at Gaby once, it was good. Service was nicely executed.
Internet:
It is only charged per room, not by device which is good....It is easy to connect to, but annoyingly slow at times...!
Laundry-Drycleaning:
Only gave garments once. They were returned late + they also tried to deliver garments that were not ours at first! 
Plus my pants were probably never even laundered...! I gave them due to - icecream stains and they came back with the very same stains. Just pressed into the fabric so i both saw and felt them!!! They probably didn´t see them as the pants were dark, but that´s un-acceptable!
The hotel did however remove the crage.
Amenities-minibar:
The minibar is sufficently stocked. But the amenities are to die for! Hèrmes all the way through making bathtime most pleasureble.
Although is hould mentin that the amenities are way less chich in the regular room... """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Just L´Occitane"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". Kind of odd to make such a distinction in between the rooms.
But they do provide macaroons with their turndown service which makes almost anything forgiven, hooray!

We stayed for three nights in a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""junior suite"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". We were told that this was one of their 'newer rooms', which we later found out to mean that one of the residents (apparently the hotel was not completely converted and there are still some residents, most elderly) had passed away, and they had very recently converted the room to a hotel room. Our room didn't have the window A-C unit discussed in previous reviews, and we had to call to get one installed (next day). Also, the room didn't have the clock-radio that was promised. It wasn't worth complaining about - we made due with wake-up calls. 
I suppose the room was clean for a - star property, but it was still quite small, and the bathroom was ridiculous. We had to actually step to the side of the bathroom in order to close the door. The table and chairs and the kitchenette were useful and suprising in a --star property, and I must say that the staff was very nice. Location was good, if you have reason to be on the Upper West Side, and as New York goes, it was quiet. That is until a massive group of kids on a tour checked in, after which there was much stampeding up and down halls, and behavior you'd expect from ----- ----- year-olds. A warning - it would appear that The Milburn is on the list of at least a couple tour companies catering to kids - not sure if that's a regular annoyance throughout the year or if we were just lucky. May be a fair question to ask the reservation agent before booking.
Would I stay here again? No - but I should in fairness state that I'm not someone who frequents --star properties often. If you are looking for a property that is relatively clean and quiet, and don't mind missing some perks of a pricier property, I'd say the Milburn rates a solid - Star rating. Maybe -.-.

id13232,"On arrival the taxi driver was unable to pull up to the hotel due to the road works outside but managed to drop us at the corner. We checked in and the front desk staff were nice enough but did tell us that we had got a really small room and there was nothing we could do to change it even if we wanted to pay more as they were fully booked. Now we were expecting a small room having stayed at tourist hotels in New York before so it didn't alarm us but when we asked about the free Wi-Fi we were told there was no free service and that it was -- dollars a day (when we booked it said free Wi-Fi) he decided to throw it in though because in his words we had got a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""sucky room"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""".
We got our room keys and headed up to our room on the --th floor, at no point did anyone offer to take our bags no big deal as we only had carry on but I have never not been asked at a hotel before.
We got to the room and to be honest it was far better than we were expecting you could walk easily all the way around the bed (we had a smaller room at the New Yorker) and the bathroom looked like it had been redone recently and all the fittings were nice.
Basic is they only way to describe the room. There is a mini bar but it is locked and I believe you had to ask for the key. This meant no fridge and as a British tourist there are no tea-coffee making facilities which I found unusual. 
The toiletries were ample plus iron, ironing board, hairdryer and I am happy to report there were no bed bugs (we checked as soon as we got into the room)
The main problem was the construction which happens at night right outside the window which makes it difficult to sleep even with earplugs. Housekeeping was good also the room always looked clean and tidy when we returned at the end of they day.
We had breakfast in the room at $-- for - ($-- per peron plus tax and service) which was nice enough but not quite value for money although it came on time. Coffee, orange juice and some pastries is what you got anything else was extra it would have been nice if they had included some yoghurt or fruit.
Checking out was easy also except when they tried to charge us for a bottle of water from the locked mini bar and we were told that left luggage costs a tip to the guy that tags your bag which is fine but I would rather they just charge as I am never sure how much to tip someone for putting a sticker on your bag and putting on a shelf. We were asked what time we were coming back and they guy asked us to tip him then because he would have gone by then.
When we collected out bag they didn't offer to call us a taxi and when we asked about the shuttle bus to the airport they didn't know what we were talking about which is bad as it goes from round the corner.

Me and my friend had jst finished a summer of working and flown in from Las Vegas on a late flight. We stated on our booking form we would arrive late. We arrived at --:--. The lady at reception advised us we'd have to wait for someone to come and check us in....-- minutes later she herself told us our room had gone. There was one room left in the whole hotel. We went ahead and booked this room. As we were checking in a group of what can only be described as 'gangstas' haha walked in and started causing trouble and had to be threatened with the police to leave. 
We finally made it up to the --th floor. As soon as the lift door opened we saw that all the hotel room doors on that floor appeared to have been kicked in, they had all been battered. We got to our room which wasnt nice atall. I think the soap and toilet roll were antique. There was a breeze constantly blowing through our room, quite eerie really. I agree with the previous person who reviewed this that said the shower was like being hosed by riot police, couldnt of described it better myself. The bathroom looked like something out of psycho. There was hardly any ventilation in the room. 
Also all the time we were there we were very unhappy about leaving our bags - laptops, cameras, ipods etc in our room due to the state of the corridor. The doors of the hotel room wernt very reassuring as there were FOUR bolts on our door. We put every single one on. 
The staff were unhelpful, the reception was waterlogged, u sunk into it. We met some australians in the lift whos first words 'so is your room as bad as ours?'

The location is great!!! - blocks away from the Foggy Bottom Metro stop, which made getting around easy and cheap. We did walk down to the monuments-whitehouse, and it was a hike, but definitly a doable walk if you have the time. We definitley got a workout.
The interior of the room is very nice and well kept. There was a kitchenette with a full fridge, stove, microwave. There were some dishes and pots and pans.
The biggest drawback for me was that the pool was closed!! I booked this hotel specifically bc it had a pool and that was closed because of construction. It is very hot in DC this time of year. Also, parking is -- dollars a night, just so you know.

At first I wasn't impressed with check-in as the front desk clerk would not even answer any of our questions until she finished with a previous customer who had gone to his car for identification.

Most of the staff, with the exception of the Bell-hop & the woman who runs the shop are genuinely unhelpful - especially if you have a problem. Watch out for the bar tender's tongue if you're not a US citizen!!

All the Annex buildings have key card entry for security, however, each doorway has louvre glass panels, with - or - panes removed, through which you can place your hand (if your tall enough) and trigger the unlck sensor and thus release the door.

The service on the other hand, left something to be desired.
As I was checking in, there was a fairly big line up of people but as a platnium priority member, I took advantage of the priority line. The staff seemed very overwhelmed during the whole process and a bit flustered with so many guests.

I have no complaints about the room - I was up high and didn't have issues with hot water or anything like that. The room was small, but that's NYC.

I called the front desk who offered to send an engineer up to *my room* to fix the router (there is no router in my room) and was also offered a number to call tech support.

id13270,"As a regular W customer with SPG status, I often stay in W hotels. I was working in LA, so we booked a group of - of us (- of us SPG gold card holders) into the W Hotel Hollywood. W is considered an aspirational brand, and most W hotels are fun, funky and supposed to be trendy. This hotel seemed to have its very own ego.
Walking past the disinterested doorman (roped off, presumably to """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""keep the riff-raff out""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""?), upon entry they require guests to deposit $--- on a credit card (yes, $---!) even if your room & tax are pre-paid. Now one of our party didn't have $--- left on his card, and had arrived a day earlier while we made our way to LA. The hotel staff were quite happy to send him back out into the street without negotiation (even though his room had been pre-paid!). Thankfully (though after a lot of persuasion to largely deaf ears) we were able to use one of our own cards over the phone to place the deposit. Why they couldn't have just taken a smaller deposit of $--- or held his passport until we arrived, I do not know. Perhaps they were expecting him to steal the TV? This made us look bad as the colleague in question was working for us, and was technically under our hospitality. Not a nice experience after a -- hour long haul flight.
A day later the rest of the party arrived and checked in. Well, we tried. Despite having high status with SPG and it being nearly -pm, our rooms were not ready. We were offered a room DOWNGRADE (note that normally you are offered an upgrade) if we needed to check into our rooms, which we did. We took the room downgrade as we were working at night at a concert. I would have expected to have some kind of credit applied to my room ($-- or so or a free drink? Would have made me feel a lot happier about the experience).
At the outside bar we ordered snacks from a waitress that can only be described as indifferent and obnoxious, firing verbal abuse at our party when we were annoyed at slow service. Once the bill arrived, we discovered why - service is added to all bills. Normally in the USA service in restaurants and bars is impeccable, because the staff have to work for it. Not here - they get it added anyway, so there is no need to go the extra mile as they do in the rest of LA.
My experience of the W hotel Hollywood has tarnished the whole W brand for me. Thankfully I understand SPG hotels are owned by different companies - important as I would not want to give any more of my money to this particular organisation. I have stayed in W Hotels cities all over the USA and never had a problem.
I should point out at this point that the rooms in the West Hollywood W are extremely nice. Comfortable beds etc. It is the staff that let the hotel down (and the whole W brand nationally as a result), with their snobby attitude towards guests. Totally unnecessary, and to think we PAID to stay there. Surely you pay to be treated with respect in a hotel, and equally guests should respect the staff? It is even an effort to get in and out of the hotel, with guests treated as rather incidental to the whole """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""party scene"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" of the property.
There is more. My friend ordered room service and received completely the wrong order, and I was charged - times for internet access despite being there for under -- hours. Thankfully after having to ask twice, this was removed, as was the room service charge.
Will the management contact me to resolve this? I seriously doubt it. It takes something for me to take the time and effort to complain, but I shall be on the phone to SPG to let them know of my experience.

A new station called New York Ave just opened early this year, which is on the red line one stop beyond Union Station and about a -- minute walk from the hotel. Given my criteria for choosing the hotel, it accomplished what I needed -- I was able to walk to and from the metro station and get downtown convenveniently.
However, there were several problems that would cause me to pay the extra $-- next time and stay someplace nicer. First, I felt somewhat unsafe walking from the metro stop to the hotel at --pm on Sunday night when I arrived in the city. It certainly wasn't in the ghetto, but you do have to walk past several storage facilities and other businesses that are not open late at night, which makes the area feel very dark and isolated. There aren't any nearby convenient stores, drug stores, or restaurants to draw lights and people. The set up of the lobby also conveyed a sense that this wasn't the best part of town -- the attendant sat behind full glass and all transactions were done through a small hole. That said, you are walking along a rather busy street the whole time, so you're probably safe enough. And I did feel much better in the morning when it was light out. Second, the hotel itself was very old and somewhat run down. There were a lot of stains and rust in the bathroom, the hair dryer was missing, and the soap was very minimalist. This made the hotel feel somewhat dirty, although I had no reason to suspect it was anything other than just old.
If all you want is a cheap hotel within walking distance of a metro stop, this will work just fine.

We asked a local about safety in walking to some the the events and she responded that normally it wouldn't be safe but because of the games police presence was heightened in that area and the normal criminals knew to stay away! Upon return to our room there was a man a few doors down and was scratching like he was coming down off of drugs and asked us if we """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""had anything"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""".
I had to put something over a spot on the sheet the first night and the next day pulled them off completed and pour water on them to ensure they would be changed.

The pictures on the web site must be at least -- years old or the rooms have seen a lot of use.
It was in walking distance to the Uptown Cabaret which I found out was a strip club so there was local entertainment. Getting food however was another issue as there were no restaurants locally that stayed open late and no local shopping.

id13324,"We were here for three days on a convention. We stay in hotels appx ------ nights-yr all over the country and it has been a while since we've been to one like this. The downstairs looks nice, a bit rough around the edges if you look closely. Location is great (- block from the T), nearby restaurants are great (Legal Seafood, Smith & Wollensky), elevators were generally prompt, ballroom looked nice (but had a rough area or two). Then you get upstairs.
The hallways had these odd concrete blocks jutting out (where room service dishes would stay for hours). The doors had these odd curved door-in-door openings (?) that looked -- years old.
The room was rather small, and stayed somewhat clammy (the air conditioner never really cooled much). The furniture was economy and old. The bathroom was small and part old, part redone -- an old industrial toilet (loud) and new shower with plastic false tiles (like you might see at a Days Inn). Oh yes, and hair (not ours). No counter space, the hairdryer was stuck in the top drawer of the dresser in the room. The plastic Kleenex box cover had its bar-code sticker still on it. Classy.
The room was a religious experience -- the sheets and towels were holey (towels were threadbare). Even if a place is undergoing renovations, there's no excuse for that. At least the beds were moderately comfortable. Oh yeah, and twice I saw a gnat or somesuch flying thing in the room. No roaches (glad we didn't see *those* reviews beforehand). Small closet.
Internet was cabled-Ethernet (in downtown Boston, while we get free wireless in the boonies of Mississippi???) and $---day. And while we're on the subject of downtown hotels with business clientele, no daily newspaper? Faxes aren't delivered to the room (first time we've had that happen at a convention). They advise --- hr lead time to retrieve your car from valet parking ($---day). And housekeeping wandered in once without knocking.
We asked others in the conference if their rooms were worse than ours and they said yes before we even related our stories.
We thought we were going to an upscale property, it wound up being a rather blah economy hotel at a upscale price. Don't judge this book by its cover.

The lady who checked me in was very friendly, and gave me a very large corner room on the --th floor.
I thought all was well, until I got to the room. The room had all kinds of nasties in it. The toilet was dirty, there were hairs in the bath tub, and there was even a Haagen-Dazs lid right next to the bed.
I asked to be moved, and was given the key to a much smaller and much less desirable room. I ended up asking for the old room back, but that it first be cleaned up. This was done, and an hour or so later a bottle of wine showed up at the room, which I had to politely decline due to me being a little too young to drink at the time, and exchange it for a breakfast certificate and a few bottles of water.
Despite this problem with the cleanliness, the room itself was good.

id13330,"We stayed here for a soccer tournament in March. The poor service and uncaring attitude we received from the front desk person and the night manager was the worst I have ever received at a Holiday Inn. We given room keys three times that did not work on our door. After showing them a fourth time that the key did not work, they begrudingly checked us into a room that already had guests. We had too squeeze into a smaller room with no apologies from the staff after a two hour ordeal. Calls to the Priority club folks did not help. The manager on the day shift reluctantly gave us half off of your room for one night.
This hotel is ideally located for the soccer fields, but I think the hotel realizes that and does not try very hard on their service. Holiday Inn Express should be embarassed.
The beds were comfortable and the shower was fine. That is about all that was good about our stay here.",Mozilla,Tablet,not happy
id13333,"Location is excellent and the staff was very friendly, professional and accommodating. Unfortunately, those qualities just don’t excuse some of the other areas needing improvement. 
I read the Trip Advisor reviews and called the hotel in advance to request a room on the side of the hotel where the train cannot be heard. The woman at the desk insisted that their hotel is on the riverwalk – there is no train track next to the hotel. I asked again at check-in. The front desk staff person indicated that there is a distant train that some guests staying on the “pool side” have complained about. She assigned us to a high floor room on the opposite side. While I can sleep through just about anything, I will attest that even I could hear the train which is said to be about - mile away. Lots of other background noise can be heard as well. Pack your earplugs just in case. The aesthetics and cleanliness of main lobby floor were nice. They have a small deli-style coffee shop across from the front desk which sells sandwiches, pastries, and (not so tasty) coffee drinks. (NOTE: SIP, Starbucks and McDonalds are all within walking distance).
I was pleased to find our room had a bright white duvet cover (I loathe traditional hotel bedspread; clean white beds at a hotel are always inviting). The flat screen television, sofa, and work desk are pretty standard these days. The décor of the room was fine, but the dust was disgusting! Since we were going to be stuck there for a conference for several days, I used germ killing hand wipes to wash down the nightstands and lamps – I’m pretty sure they haven’t been dusted for quite a while. 
I always wipe down the remote control and do my best to avoid using land line telephones at hotels (call me a Germaphobe – I’m not ashamed). Unfortunately, there was a message light on our phone. The phone was noticeably dirty, but I bravely pressed the button to find out who the heck had chosen to track me down at the Holiday Inn instead of my cell phone number. Much to my dismay, it was the hotel manager calling to welcome us to the Holiday Inn Riverwalk. The end of her message was apparently cut off – I gather she was in a hurry to “make the rounds.” If only someone had thought to come around and clean the telephones. Gross!
The bathroom wasn’t much better, but to be fair I have seen far worse conditions elsewhere. The corner of the shower had a small red stain (rust or possibly bacteria growth). The corners of the bathroom were dusty. If we were there for vacation, I would have left promptly. But, I put on my “camping mentality” and reluctantly decided to rough it for a few days. After all, we didn’t spend much time at the hotel.
The view from our room was made up of industrial rooftops “decorated” with a collage smashed glass – reminiscent of brown beer bottles. Obviously, the Holiday Inn cannot control the eye soar view of property that doesn’t belong to them. I imagine there are plenty of other hotels in the area with the same view. That said, I doubt there would be much desire for anyone to spend time on the balcony during the Texas summer months. By the way, this hotel does have a very small pool which appeared to be well maintained. We did not partake in any swimming activities. 
They say crickets are good luck. If that’s your belief, you will be in good company at the Holiday Inn Riverwalk. We were greeted by the hoppy lucksters on the morning of our scheduled departure. As the drapes were pulled open, I spotted something on the floor who seemed to shy away from the sun rays. It scurried under the sofa before I could identify it. It turned out to be a Texas-sized Cricket who hopped out to wish us farewell. After inquiring with other guests in the elevator, I gather that crickets have been spotted all over the hotel. Even the rooms on the top floors have crickets, though they may not come out until night. Let this be a warning to all “Campers” at the Holiday Inn Riverwalk – don’t forget to wear your shower shoes and carry a flash light at night. 
Valet service is available, but I recommend parking in the attached garage. The garage elevator connects to the hotel. Self-parking costs $-- per day. Considering that the garage gate attendant was only on duty - night out of -, I’m guessing that a lot of folks got to park there for free. 
The Holiday Inn is not my usual hotel of choice, though I have stayed in some very nice Holiday Inn's and I'm not opposed to trying others in the future. For business, I usually stay at a Hampton Inn, Courtyard, or Residence Inn. There is a Marriott Courtyard next door, but based on the TripAdvisor reviews I don’t think it would have been much of an improvement over there. Next time, I may consider staying at Omni La Mansion del Rio. That hotel was beautiful and seems to get great reviews. 
My San Antonio Restaurant Reviews (all are vegetarian friendly by request)…
Casa Rio – A bit spicier than I'm used to. Very good food and service!
Mi Tierra Café & Bakery – Excellent food, pastries, service. They make the best margarita I’ve ever had (we ordered - pitchers to share). We enjoyed dinner here and then returned to the bakery several times. Delicious!
Spaghetti Warehouse – Decent food if you’re craving a very casual Italian. It wasn’t all that I had experienced at another location many years ago.
Hard Rock Café – typical, pretty good.
Ritas On The River – Great for people watching. Geared toward family fun as they have a caricature artist, mariachi band, and balloon twister (for the kids). If you like your margarita served in a traditional margarita glass, you’ll have to order the “jumbo.” I ordered a small Don Juan margarita ($--) on the rocks and it came in a plain lager-style glass – a little too sour for my taste. 
McD's - hardly Texas cuisine, but it may be nice to know it's within walking distance of riverwalk and The Alamo. Dollar Menu not available at this historic location. Also, I was surprised that the - entrances had steps (no handicap- stroller access visible to me -- but perhaps I just missed that).",Firefox,Tablet,not happy

The hotel is situated in a good location, especially for Broadway and Times Square.

Our room was fairly high up with an unpleasant view of an avenue, but in New York you're only in your room to sleep and we got our best sleep ever staying here.
The room was on the small side for New York but the bed was one of the best we have tried , and we have tried alot of beds! 
The bathroom was lovely and the shower was great for shower voyeurs. It was sort of fixed to the end of the bath, so that if you had a bath you could watch your partner shower. Those that have been will know what I mean.
Hotel facilities are what you would expect for a New York Hotel of this standard but the toiletries were nothing special.
We went to the Red Diner next door and found it filled a hole, however we found nicer places than this for our Breakfast.
New York is excellent and we will definitely go again. We highly recommend the Comedy Cellar for a great night out, Central Park - the squirrels are so tame, Brooklyn Bridge and Brooklyn for the sunset view of Manhatten.

id13341,"The only good things I can say about Harborside Inn, Boston, is that the room was clean and it is in a convenient location to the waterfront. We travel a great deal and the staff was probably the most unhelpful we have ever encountered. Today, I asked if they could provide driving directions to the JFK Museum. The woman at the desk, on a personal phone call, just answered """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""No"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". That was it. We had other similar encounters with this unhelpful staff and also observed others. The hotel has no parking and the recommended parking facility was a few blocks away and quite expensive (about $--.-- for two days - with the discount!). When you arrive there are no directions regarding where to park to check in, what to do, etc. No staff member offers to help with your luggage or provides any guidance whatsoever. We saw the person checking in after us actually receive a parking ticket from an unsympathetic meter maid. If you are planning to stay in Boston, near the Financial Area, stay in the Marriott instead. By the time you pay for parking, the rates will probably be very similar.

Bottom line on this property is that it is in desperate need of an update. I knew it was old just from the ----s painted driveway as I walked into the lobby. My first room which was on the -rd floor had a pleasant looking bed, but the carpeting was old and dingy, the bathroom was small and looked like the original from ----, and somehow they managed to put Fred Flintsone's television in the room as well.
The staff was very pleasant though and accomodating. I asked if there were more recently updated rooms available and thankfully, I was relocated to the --th floor where the room was updated. Updated bathroom around the original tub, with a granite countertop sink that was seperate from the toilet and shower. High ceilings, with updated furniture, lighting fixtures, and wallpaper, as well as a --"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" LCD sans HD. The only complaints there were a musty smell from the AC, a flat screen TV with no HD, and a very large plastic plant which seemed to cheapen the whole experience.

- Location: Good, in Union Square and close proximity to Chinatown. BART and Muni stations are close by so access to other city sights are convenient. Bakery, CVS pharmacy, Starbucks, and MickeyDees are less than a block away. 
- Room: Tall ceilings made the room felt bigger than it actually was. Floor-to-ceiling window was a plus. Beds were too soft and springy for my taste (I can hear the springs whenever I move and felt them digging in my back) . I had a second floor room and there were some street noise but it wasn't too bad. The lamps in the room have all seen better days.The bathroom was serviceable but definitely not luxurious in any way and I really do question why they included a bathroom phone but not a hairdryer.
- Amenities: The pool was great but there was only one tiny hot-tub. The gym was small with probably a dozen pieces of equipment but more than half were broken. There was a sauna room as well. 
- Service: Housekeeping was great. We left really late one day and got a note to call housekeeping if we wanted our room cleaned but when we got back, the room was spanking clean again w-o us calling them.
However, there was no other service that was representative of a - * hotel. The doormen were never there or didn't even pay us any attention whenever we came in-out of the hotel with our hands full of bags.

The hotel at the time had an odd lobby situation up on the second floor I think it was and really only a desk and a few chairs, not really a hotel lobby, but it did the job and I think it is one of the still to be completed renovation projects along with the swimming pool. 
The room was very stylish with dark timber floors and furniture and pale coloured walls which gave it a bit of a designer look, but a little impractical as there was virtually no storage space. There was a small open closet with some hangers and a shelf above it but no drawer space at all apart from a very tiny one in the desk which was barely big enough for an ipod let alone any clothing. 
In addition to a lack of furniture there was absolutely nothing in the room to give you any guide to the hotel, no guide to the TV or phone, not even which extension was the front desk, nothing about the local area not even that little card that is on the back of every hotel door with the room rates and the hotel liability policy or a guide to where the fire escapes were.
The room had a great LCD TV with a good selection of stations, very comfortable king size bed with great linens and nice towels and the bathroom had been renovated nicely.
Parking was free when I stayed there but I think is usually $-- per night, but like a lot of motels in Los Angeles there just isn’t enough spaces to cope with the number of guests and the hotel allows cars to be parked behind already parked cars and they keep the keys and move the cars if needed, not an ideal situation if you are in a hurry to leave.

id13527,"We recently returned from staying - nights in June at this hotel as a family vacation trip to tour the San Diego area. While we found the hotel staff to be very friendly and overall helpful, the room to be clean overall, and the location to be great, there were several things that this hotel fell short on. The first thing is parking.....instead of assigning each room one slot, it is a free for all. Upon check in at --:-- a.m. there were no parking spaces left. We were told to park by the road which we did. Then early the next morning (and we had flown in from Massachusetts so were exhausted) the front desk phoned the room to tell us to move the car so a delivery truck could get in. Upon moving the vehicle, we saw that apparently the sprinkler system had gone off and the entire driver's side was covered with water.....now normally this would not be a problem but the water must have had sediment in it because it caused water spots all over the car which we had to clean off in order to be able to see to drive. Secondly, the room (we stayed in #---) had an odd smell everytime you entered the room.....it was clean enough but the smell was weird (maybe the carpets?) The room was VERY dated.....a new coat of paint, carpet and new bedspreads would really make a difference. The AC also sometimes changed into a mode when running that was loud and other times was fine. We tried to use the pool but there was a ton of kids in it splashing water everywhere so we left. Apparently they had two large groups staying there for soccer and football tournaments. We tried the pool once these groups checked out and it was better but we could smell sewerage while sitting by the pool which was coming from somewhere nearby....maybe the hotel or the pump house?

id13544,"As others have pointed out, the Intercontinental Boston has terrible service. For such a nice property and global brand reputation, I expected MUCH better customer service. I'll try to explain what I think is going on after second trip.
My comments are based on two trips. One in August --, ---- and most recently on August --, ----. This was a family trip. We booked two rooms. The second for my mother in-law. Our August --, ---- trip was cut short due to a hotel fire. Back then, the hotel did a terrible job handling the fire. My comparison - comments are based on other hotel brands I've stayed at over the years including the Ritz Carlton, Four Seasons, Fairmont, Omni, Marriott, and Hyatt.
This Intercontinental Boston is a relatively new hotel. The rooms are spacious and beautiful. The hotel is about a ----- minute walk to Faneuil Hall marketplace and about ----- minute walk to the North End. This trip (Aug. ----), we managed to check in early. I noticed the hotel did not seem busy. 
As with most properties, this hotel has both residential and commercial tenants. This is where I believe the problems stem with customer service. Clearly the hotel guests seemed to be second class priority. The desk clerks seemed to be very confused and unclear about hotel policies. For instance when my wife tried to take our -- year old son to the gym, she was told by the gym supervisor than anyone under -- was not allowed to use any of the equipment (cycles, treadmill, etc.). However,the front desk clerk said that minors (kids) could use the facility as long as they were supervised by an adult. The second day, the front desk clerk told us that under no circumstances kids under -- could use the gym facility. When I asked them directly if this is a private gym for the resident tenants, they denied it. 
We paid extra to stay at the club level. But, they have VERY set times when they open up and when the food + drinks are out. They open up much later on the weekends. So, if you like to start your day early on the weekends (before -:-- am) skip the club level amenities. In fact they were -- minutes late opening up for us during our stay; they did not open up till -:-- pm. They don't setup in the evening until -:-- pm. So, even though we paid $--- extra per night, we hardly used the club level. In fact we were the only ones at the club.
During this trip, a member of our party had a terrible accident walking back from the North End and we desperately needed a first aid kit at - pm in the evening. We could not find any open CVS of pharmacy within the - mile radius. None the convenient stores has even a Band-Aid. Finally we approached the hotel for assistance. It took us several attempts to get the point across to them that we needed a first aid kit. Reluctantly and -- minutes later someone showed up with some supplies. For a property this big, I expect the staff to be more responsive to guests that may be in need of medical attention. I guess they have not learned from the August ---- fire. Do not expect this hotel to handle any medical or other emergency.
Parking sucks. Although this hotel provides parking, the rates clearly want you to park your car someplace else. The rate is $-- - night irrespective of weekends. You can find most public parking will charge between $- - $-- for weekends. I think anything less than - hours is around $-- and anything over is still $--. Cleary this parking lot is for residential clients.
The bottom line, this hotel property is NOT FAMILY or customer oriented. This property caters to residential guests (these are multimillion dollar condos where everyone drives around a Bentley or Ferrari). You can see the fleet of cars at the parking level. Don't expect this hotel to be consistent on policies. There's a lot of flip flopping on what the policies are. Club level food is OK, but the hours are very limited and inconvenient. Don't expect any help if you need any medical attention or supplies. I don't expect the hotel to have any best practices in case of a fire or emergency. And don't expect to see a manager or supervisor on weekends. In fact we never engaged by anyone above a front desk assistance. The Boston Intercontinental sets a very poor example for what customer service should not be. If you're travelling with family, kids, and for the summer, I would recommend staying at one of the more family friendly hotels that has it act together. I can tell you my wife will never stay at any Intercontinental brand every again.",Edge,Tablet,not happy
id13547,"We stayed here for a conference. They made multiple screw ups, some small and some big.
Our first night we arrived exhausted with our small children in tow. We were pressured to hurry and unload even though there was no one else waiting behind us to get into the loading-unloading zone. I felt rather unwelcome, as that made getting settled quite stressful. We then got room service for dinner, and ordered a set of mini burgers for our toddler for dinner (kids menu). They arrived rare, which we did not ask for and is really dangerous for a kids' entree. I called to complain and they were actually gracious and gave us a fruit platter to compensate. This is the only time they made good on mistakes.
Housekeeping walked into our room twice while we had the do not disturb sign up, once while our infant was asleep and the other time my husband was urinating. They never knocked.
Their only parking option is valet, so we paid the $---day for that. When we went to pick up the car, we saw that the door on my husband's brand new car had clearly been hit into a concrete wall, a big dent and scrape. The dash heads-up display that was glued on had been ripped off and stepped on and no longer works. Between these two things that was nearly $---- damage to the car.

id13551,"All in all, I thought this hotel was pretty average. The room was good, but definitely not big enough for more than two travelers. I wasn't super happy with the cable station choices, very limited. While I totally get that people don't usually stay in their room during a trip, I was traveling alone so it would have been nice to have a few more options. There was a loud squealing noise that I can only imagine was the water pipes, but it's an older building. That kind of stuff can happen. My room was clean and I liked the free water and bottles, though the hotel could really use a recycling program to go with all of the plastic bottles that must get tossed. I found the staff to be helpful and friendly, but definitely business like. Which makes sense since this is a business hotel most of the time.
The area was OK, but I would have enjoyed staying in the Old City-Society Hill area better. This hotel is in the middle of a very busy shopping district and the outside noise never really quiets down. It didn't bother me a ton, but it's something for other travelers to know.
Here's my one huge complaint. Some of the rooms have odd doorways -- two rooms share a very short """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""hallway"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" and the two doors are at a -- degree angle from each other. My room was like that, but it also happened to have a door to close off the short hallway from the main hall. Not all short hallway rooms had this door. Anyway, after a long day of site-seeing, I found that door closed and my key wouldn't open it. The front desk staff was very helpful and unlocked the door, but they had to get a special key and pop off a lock cover to open it. The people next to me insisted on closing this door, even after I wrote a friendly note explaining the situation. While this situation was not the hotel's fault, I really think that there should be some kind of notice about the door problem. Not to mention that it's just kinda creepy as a solo traveler to have my room closed off from the main hallway with some (apparently thoughtless) neighbors next to me.
I would recommend this hotel to someone, but I don't think it's the best option in Philadelphia.",Safari,Desktop,not happy

Okay, so I asked for another room - lucky I did because while I had requested a high floor the hotel had booked us on the lowest floor. We are now moved up to the highest floor. Problem #- - this room is not ready either and will take at least - hour to prepare. My son and I leave to get food and come back to check in after -pm - luckily the room is just now ready (funny but I thought check-in was earlier than this). We arrive at the room and discover problem #- - my SPG (Platinum) profile indicates a preference for a quiet room (away from elevators, etc.), which I had also asked for while checking in, yet we are assigned the room closest to the elevator bank. At this point we are both tired and decide to stick it out. Overall the room is okay - bathroom extremely small, absolutely NO water pressure (I can spit harder and probably produce more liquid too), the drapes are soiled and two of them are missing the rods making them difficult to open and close, and many of the TV channels are all static (did not discover this until our last night). The worst thing about the room though is that the bed I slept in was the worst Starwood hotel bed I have ever experienced - so bad that my back was bothering and I had a difficult time sleeping.

Very close to public transit system-- in almost any direction you can find a subway station a block or two away, bus stops also nearby; we also took the train-bus to and from the airport instead of paying for a cab. Tip: get a --day or --day unlimited pass
Hotel staff -- friendly-helpful, offered to have towels delivered to our room, doormen always gave us good directions
Clean and secure -- clean sheets and towels (see note regarding towel service below), - manual locks on room door; main lobby door is locked after a certain time but there is always a doorman to let guests in
Con's:
Old hotel -- in much need of restoration-renovation, old furniture-fixtures, bathroom door did not close completely; however, some rooms seems to have had a recent facelift such as a new stone bathroom floor and new curtains
Large hotel with minimum hotel staff -- translation=some areas may not be cleaned on a regular basis, dusty carpet and closet in room, lobby is more like a college dorm lobby
Noise -- windows and walls are thin -- You can hear the city noises from outside; also, we could hear people in the hallway easily, but luckily everyone on our floor was considerate and relatively quiet.
Infrequent towel service -- you must request towels to be exchanged at front desk (otherwise, towels are only changed every - days)

id13562,"We stayed at the W San Francisco from December --th through the --th. It was not our first stay at the hotel, and we previously had a very favorable opinion of it. 
Not anymore. 
Let's begin with the shameless manner in which the W San Francisco charges for incidentals. There are all kinds of nasty hidden surprises. One example is a $-- to $-- and up """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""package handing fee"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" to bring boxes or packages from the hotel loading dock to the guest room. This includes FedEx packages. Then there's the $- per page incoming fax fee. I can understand recouping a reasonable sum for ink and paper and even making a reasonable profit but at that rate I could have purchased my own fax machine over the duration of my stay. 
All seasoned travelers know that minibars are an unholy rip-off. But the W San Francisco gives new meaning to this term. The price list next to the snack goodies breaks out the costs, but you must look very closely at the fine print; there is a --% """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""restocking fee"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" tacked on to the numbers listed. This is very easy to miss and a very immoral business practice. 
I awoke, very thirsty in the middle of our first night, so I grabbed the water the hotel had conveniently set next to my bed. Sure, they've got fancy artesian water in the room, and again, I would expect a reasonable premium for this. Well, the W San Francisco seems to have no problem charging guests $- a bottle ... that's right folks, EIGHT bucks for a lousy ---oz. Bottle of water. 
Then there was the night we wanted a stiff drink before bed. We sauntered over to the W bar for two long island iced teas. I was in total disbelief when I saw the bartender concoct a drink consisting of about --% sour mix, -% Coke, and maybe -% alcohol for $-- each. I am not exaggerating one bit. It was totally undrinkable. 
Parking ... again, I understand their need to charge a lot. After all, the location is prime real estate and they've got a valet staff to pay. Most garages in the area charge around $--- a month for self-parking. The garage down the street charges $-- per night. So, hey, $-- or $-- wouldn't be so bad with all those full service valet guys. But no. The W San Francisco seems to think that $-- every two nights is perfectly okay to charge people for PARKING. Oh, and be careful if you decide to park off property and use the valet to run up to your room for five minutes because the hotel will tack on $-- plus tax to your room bill. 
Some readers may be thinking """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""yeah yeah... this guy is just upset because he spent more money than he could afford at an expensive hotel."""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" I only wish that were true, because I'd have far less of a problem. The truth is, we found many of the hotel's staff to be both rude and unresponsive. 
Now don't get me wrong here. There were many very helpful and friendly folks. But we found that a handful of people working the front desk were the reliably slow and unfriendly. We noticed this was a pattern more than just a few isolated incidents. 
Oh, and remember the package delivery fees, and the $- fax pages? Let's talk about those for a moment. I sent a FedEx package for Saturday delivery at a huge expense to ensure its timely arrival. I arrived on Sunday night and asked for it upon check-in. Three different people insisted the package was not at the hotel after repeated requests to locate it. It was not until I could contact the shipping clerk at my company on Monday morning to prove that the package had in fact arrived on Saturday that I was able to retrieve it. 
The same goes for the faxes... I could only get them delivered by repeatedly badgering the front desk staff, and only then would they send them up. In one instance, a fax sat downstairs for nearly two hours before it was brought up to my room after repeated requests.
Overpriced and spotty service. That's enough to keep me away for a good long time, but the discomfort of the guest room really put the whole experience over the top. The mattress was hard as a rock. After five days, my companion developed deep dark rings around his eyes from inability to sleep. I'm not sure if this was just isolated to my room but it was hugely disappointing. You'd think with all the money generated from the $- water bottle sales and $--.-- parking fees and other annoying nickel and dime fees that they'd at least keep the beds in good shape. 
The pool area is in need of a facelift with dirty, worn pool cushions, and the treadmills are older base models.

I called the manager to help me out with this and the only thing they were able to offer was open windows (Its winter in NY, so freezing) or a plastic fan that makes noise just like the construction site next door.

It was pretty cheap and in a good location so I was initially content with my decision since I was only staying for a single night. However, they use very poor quality key cards that didn't work every time I went up to my room. I had to go down to the front desk to re-program the key.
The first time I went to get the key fixed, the front desk person asked me which room I was staying in and fixed the key.....she didn't ask for ID or for my name and I was wondering if she actually remembered me from - hours prior when I checked in....I didn't say anything. The second time, it was a guy named Luis Garza and I knew he had never seen me before......I told him my problem and he asked which room and re-programmed the key (again, did not ask for an ID or even for my name!). The third time was the same guy.....he once again asked for my room number and re-programmed the key and apologized that the hotel uses poor quality keys. 
When I checked out the next morning, I complained to the front desk person and she had me fill out a complaint form and apologized as if it doesn't routinely happen. You can tell that they get asked to re-program keys all of the time and that it is a basic routine for them. 
This hotel is just asking to get ripped off by some thief so do yourself a favor and stay as far away from this hotel as possible!!! There are plenty of other places to stay for the same price in the same location.

For the location & proximity to everything (including a marvelous little Mexican restaurant around the corner), you can't beat this place for the price.

The woman at the front desk was very helpful, even leaving to personally check if the room was ready because we had arrived early for check-in. It was, and she gave us a large cold bottle of Evian, a goodie bag with large cookies and a CD, and a short tour of our room and its amenities. We were also given - room keys, which is helpful. 
The room was a suite (they are all suites) facing -st Avenue. The bed looked like one large pillow and it was amazingly soft and comfortable. We had to force ourselves, after testing it, to get up and do some exploring around town. The room had a --"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" TV which came in handy because we were there to see the Seahawks VS. Giants that Sunday at Quest Field Stadium, so we were able to keep track of the teams and highlights on a picture-perfect TV. The bathroom had a stall shower and was pretty basic - hairdryer, lots of towels, and complimentary toileties. The room closet had a dresser, iron and board, and - ultra-soft bathrobes. There was also a seperate coffee-office closet which was pretty convenient, yet out of the way. And the leather sofa and chair were nice, as well. The most useful thing in the room was the pile of Seattle guides on the sofa table. We used that to find all the restaurants for our entire stay. 
The Inn is located only a half mile from Seattle Center (with Space Needle) and less than a mile striaight down -st to Pike Market. It's only a little further to Pioneer Square and Quest Field Stadium. And it's only - blocks away from the Seattle Port. First Avenue has an abundance of restaurants and shops so you won't have to worry about taking a taxi to dinner. (There's even a big umbrella for you in the room closet, just in case you have to take a short walk in the rain!)

On arrival we were very impressed with the lobby area, all be it small, it was bright and airy with crystal and glass in cabinets all around. The doormen were very attentive too. 
It was when you entered the lifts that the bright and airy feel dissapeared. The lift was very nice and oppulent but dark, once up to the --th floor, we were met with a very dark, slightly creepy in a nice way corridor. This hotel must have just been renovated because everything was immaculate.
Our room was a surprise, it was quite big and even though the decor was a little busy, we did like it, the bathroom was large, with good qaulity fixtures. The bath towels and robes were light and fluffy and the tioletries were replaced everyday. The soaps they use a lovely too, and WOW what a great shower. 
The room itself had a very large flat screen TV mounted on the wall, we also had a floor to ceiling mirror on one wall and floor to ceiling windows. The bed was super-king size and the bed was very comfortable. As we are super fussy on bed quality we did make sure the beds were pillow-top and it was like a big marshmellow.
All the fixtures and fittings, looked to be brand new. Be warned though as some of the mini bar items, water, ect, snacks are placed on the tray with your glasses and cocktail shakers and they are not free. 
We did have room service once and it was good and reasonably priced. We ate at Bin-- for breakfast a few times and found it very nice indeed.
There is a new Bar called The Crimson Lounge, gosh this place looked like a Vampire's Lure, very gothic, red and so dark, you could hardly see the person sat next to you on some tables. It was very busy on the weekend we where there, with lots of young girls aged around -- - --, dressed to impress, not our cup of tea really.
We did like Chicago, not so much as NY but we managed to see lots of sights. 
Harry Carays is a nice Bar ect. We also at at SMith and Wollensky but to be honest the over bearing waiter really put ut off. 
ALl in all the Sax is very well placed in the Marina, right next to the House Of Blues, were you can watch blues and eat good food, we managed to go on Sunday for the Brunch and gospel Choir, was fantastic and en experience. 
Our only gripe was our view out of the windows, of the Corn Cob Towers, the car park hosts the first -- floors, so being on floor --, we had a view of the spiral car park and also the noise.

We didn't take their advice and ended up being seriously underwhelmed by Old Town and its surroundings. Instead, visit Coronado Island if you have a free afternoon during your conference.

Value: Truly, the only issue I had with the hotel was the price. It's an expensive hotel for what one receives.

id10446,"This hotel is what you would generally expect a Homewood Suites to be like. The staff was very friendly from check-in to check-out of my two week stay. Breakfast was usually hot, and there was always enough food out. There is a Manager's Reception each Monday-Thursday night like at all Homewood's, but I did not attend one of those so I can't comment on the quality. The rooms are awesome. I was fortunate enough to be able to book a fireplace suite. They provide you one firelog for free, but any remaining logs you must buy yourself. They do sell them at the front desk, but if you are going to use more than - I would simply buy them from the nearby Target or Walmart for cheaper. The suite was very spacious. The bedroom itself is the size of your common hotel room. The living area have both a semi-comfortable chair, and a not so comfortable at all couch. The kitchens are equipped with a stove top and microwave, but there is no oven which I find to be a negative. At the very least, a convection oven combined with the microwave would be nice. You will not have a problem finding a place to store your luggage as there are plenty of closets and two sets of drawers. My room also had a patio which would be a nice addition for the Summer months. Some very important advice is that there is a railroad track that runs adjacent to this property. If you are a HiltonHonors member, you are given to option to select your room before you arrive. Rooms on the South side of the property and on the East side of the property are ones to stay away from if you are a light sleeper. My room was in the Southeast corner of the property (the absolute worst place) so I could actually feel the floors shake when the trains went by. Luckily I am not a light sleeper. As far as location, it is a short drive to several restaurants and a great shopping mall. Of course, not all business travelers have the luxury of a rental car so it is nice to be able to walk to restaurants. Well, that will not happen if you stay here. However, they do provide a shuttle that will take you anywhere within a - mile radius. I did not use the shuttle, so I can't comment on how convenient it is. Overall, this is definitely an excellent place to stay for the price. If you are familiar with the Homewood Suites brand, this property will not disappoint. Just stay away from the South and East side of the property and you will have nothing to complain about.",Opera,Tablet,happy

Our room was on the fourth floor overlooking West --th but we didn't experience any noise problems from the street below. The bedroom was typical in size for NYC, enough room for bed, furnishings, and space to maneuver. The bathroom was close to equal in size with the bedroom with a full shower and a wall shelf for toiletries. The bed was firm but comfortable, the closet and drawers provided plenty of storage space, and the lighting could be adjusted from subtle to extremely bright as needed. 
We visited the bar and ordered a cheese plate (rather plain) and drinks (fresh and delicious). The prices were typical for a hotel bar but the service was friendlier and more attentive than most we've visited. The bar is small but open to the street so there was still plenty to see.

I read a few reviews that said the rooms were small, but considering the size of an apartment in NYC, I didn't think it was that small. We had two double beds, and if we had been traveling with a third person, we probably could have squeezed in a rollaway bed. The bathroom was very clean and looked like it had been recently updated. 
A couple of cons - there was no screen on the window. We were on the --th floor and the window opened all the way, but there was no screen or any other safety feature. The bottom of the window is about -.- feet off the floor, so I kept having panic thoughts of my son (who was -- YEARS old at the time) tripping and falling out the window...a little paranoia there. lol However, I would not recommend this for someone traveling with a small child. Also, I could have sworn the rooms were advertised as having air conditioning. This one did not. I'm guessing they put window units in during the summer, but since it was still March, they hadn't put them in yet (it was unseasonably warm while we were there). That's just my guess, anyway.
The other thing that was a little odd was that the door lock looked like it had been broken before. I suppose if someone is really paraniod, this might be an issue. However, they have someone at the front desk -- hours a day. As a matter of fact, when you go out, they ask that you give them your room key and they will give it back when you return. Unheard of in this day, but it was kind of cool because you get to know the front desk people and they get to know you. They will ask for ID if they don't recognize you, but otherwise, they'll just give you your key. Again, I suppose if someone is super paranoid, this might be an issue, but I felt very safe there - more safe than staying at a motel with outside entry in the middle of nowhere. 
Also, if you're not used to sleeping in a noisy city, I would recommend bringing ear plugs. The windows are super thin and you can hear traffic and people ALL NIGHT - it is only a couple of blocks from Time Square, so be prepared for traffic noise. I actually slept with a white noise track on my MP- player all night, and as soon as I dozed off, I didn't notice the noise anymore.

id10521,"My wife and I stayed one night at the fairly new JW Marriott in Indianapolis in mid-July. We normally stay at the Conrad what visiting Indy but decided to try out the new hotel. 
The hotel is over-sized - probably -X the size of the Conrad. Almost reminds one of a Vegas-style hotel. The styling of the hotel is very modern-eclectic - it stands in sharp contrast to the more conservative and traditional Conrad styling. I personally prefer the Conrad but I'm sure others will prefer the JW. The JW lobby is loud and busy - Conrad is quiet and reserved.
The service was generally pretty good - however, the luggage did take over -- minutes to get to the room. I finally went down stairs to retrieve the luggage at which point the bell man brought it up. We did not order room service or eat at the restaurants so we got little exposure to the service other than the valet, which was fine.
The room view was spectacular. We were on the top floor and had an end room - two walls with floor to ceiling glass. Amazing. This is one area that the Conrad can not complete with JW - the views. Otherwise, the room was like the lobby - more modern in design. The office chair looks like something from my parents --'s kitchen. Take note: the bathroom does NOT have a tub - least not in our room. Also, the room did not have a couch (which you get at the Conrad) although there is room for one. But overall the room was very nice, beds were comfortable.
The pool is very small - smaller than Conrad and I do not like the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""raised"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" design of the pool. Hot tub was nice sized and the excerise facility was very large. One area where the Conrad is obviously superior to the JW is the changing-shower facilities for the pools and excercise rooms. There is no comparison. Conrad feels like an exclusive golf club with dry-wet sauna, multiple showers, many free amenities etc. The JW feels like a public changing area with no saunas and few free amenities. The Conrad comes equipped with robes and they are nowhere in sight at the JW. 
The presence of a Starbucks in the meetings area is a nice feature.
Overall, the new JW is a great new hotel in Indy but my vote is still that Conrad is a distant first. If you are an executive used to high-end treatment, it's my opinion the JW probably will not quite satisfy like the Conrad.",Mozilla,Mobile,happy

id10526,"I just completed a --night stay at the Philadelphia Westin. This hotel was picked for me because it was across the street from the building where the office I was visiting was located. Good location for me, but I don't know if I'd pick this spot if I was a tourist. It was nice to be near the food court at the Liberty Place and the other restaurants around within walking distance, but most of the tourist stuff wasn't around where I was located. 
The service was great. Everyone from the front door staff to the folks at the front desk to the people with guest services-room service were very nice. On a couple of different occasions, my room key failed to work, and the staff was great about having new cards programmed for me so I didn't have to wait too long. Prices through room service and down at the restaurant were a little steep, but probably not much different from other big cities. 
In general, I'd say room cleanliness was pretty good. There were a couple of questionable stains on the wall near the bed, as well as a couple on sheets-pillowcases on certain days. Also, there was one day where I found a wash cloth with a red spot. I tossed it on the floor, assuming housekeeping would replace it. The next day when I picked up a new wash cloth from the counter, I found another red spot...surprisinly similar to the one from the previous day. No proof it was indeed the same...but no proof it wasn't.
The heavenly beds are still pretty good...not as fantastic as I remember from my last Westin stay, but since I wasn't getting a ton of sleep at night anyway, it wasn't really mattering much.

 I usually stay fairly neat, and need little service from the maids. My biggest problem and one of the reasons they lose a star is because I placed the do not disturb sign up, and the maids still came in and cleaned. They did this - or - days in a row. If I pay for a room and place a sign up that says do not disturb, I expect them to respect it. The maid was Asian and spoke almost no English, so I assume she couldn't read the sign either.

I brought two different friends by, and since the door locks to the elevator and she buzzes you in after she identifies you, she needs an I'd from any visitor's .

It was fine and met all of my expectations - the staff were friendly and very welcoming; the room was clean and comfy; the bed was very comfortable and the air was breathable; and the location was just what I needed.
It is a slightly out of the way corner and if you're new to NY you might be a bit spooked by the environment in the nearby block or two, since there are wholesale flower warehouses, downmarket shops and at the moment there is lots of construction going on. In fact, it's not at all a seedy or 'low rent' neighbourhood and when you walk half a block over to -th or -th avenue you feel part of the city again - don't be put off!
I didn't try any of the food except for breakfast on the first day, which was pretty much as you'd expect, and politely served. The 'pantry' was a good idea - if you're a Brit shaking off the time difference you can stock up on snack food to keep you going when you wake up at -am!

The hotel isn't down the nicest of New York roads, but lets face it, you walk from your hotel to explore the city and back down the road, to the hotel for a nights sleep. It's not enough to worry about. Just a couple of seedy shops. Reception had free coffee in the mornings and warm apple in the afternoon. This was an added extra because you could just grab a takeaway coffee-apple and head to your destination. The hotel was apporx --- mins from Times Square. Not far at all.

Our expectations were exceeded at every turn. Yes, the location is fantastic. But the hotel did not disappoint in any way!

And they do this window treatment that is difficult to describe but so lovely.
OK, let's discuss the bar. We were out late, came in for a nightcap. The music was loud, the lighting was dim, the cocktails were a perfect nightcap. The feel was very sexy, and we had a great time.

First of all, it was under a $--- a night, which is unheard of in Chicago, unless you're seeking out hostiles. The location was ideal, within walking distance from the majority of the downtown attractions, including the Willis Tower SkyDeck, Millennium Park, the Art Institute and Buckingham Fountain. (Which is good, because we found the the subway line wasn't very helpful for tourist destinations.) The room itself, while quite small, was tastefully decorated, immaculately clean and very comfortable. I only noticed noise from other rooms on one night, the rest of the time you could hear a pin drop. We were on the --th floor, so city noise was minimal and the elevators were insanely fast and you never had to wait long to get one. The staff was very pleasant and helpful. I liked the fact that there was a lot of serve-yourself conveniences, though I could see others viewing that as a detraction. For instance, you check in-out using an electronic kiosk, if you want an extra blanket or ironing board, you find a guest closet in the hallway and help yourself. They offered a gym, a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""living room"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" to hang out in, and free bottled water on every floor at the elevators. The pub connected next door had very tasty and reasonably priced food. And if you need to park a car, we did the self park for $---day (roughly $-- cheaper than just choosing a garage), which was a short - minute walk away, though they do offer valet if you so desire.
The only negative I can come up with is the thermostat...it was impossible to figure out how to get the heat on, and the room was too chilly the whole time. We should have asked at the front desk as I'm sure they could have helped us, we just never made the time or forgot.

id10685,"I would definitely stay at Chicago's House of Blues Hotel again, despite a few 'caveat emptor' notes. First, they gave away our room the first of three nights. However, they put us up in the nearby, fancy Ritz-Carlton (a far superior but boring luxury hotel), even giving us cab fare to and from the Ritz. Why did this happen? 'A group came in,' the unsmiling young clerk said, as though bracing for a tirade. 
Thinking maybe it was a group of groupies for some band playing at the HOB next door, we didn't protest much. I suspected it also had to do with the fact that we booked through Expedia, but can't substantiate that. Expedia was great. After paying in advance and having Expedia alert the hotel in writing that we were arriving late and us calling the hotel directly that afternoon from the east coast to confirm ('yes, we have your reservation'), it sucked coming from the airport and being summarily told there was no room. But points to the HOB for putting us up at the Ritz-Carlton (which failed to give us the requested roll-away cot when they didn't have a room with two beds for two straight guys so one of us slept on the floor on a bedspread at the Ritz after coming in at - a.m. but that's another story). Anyway, next morning, we called the HOB to tell them we were coming over for our room. 'Yes, sir, we have three rooms with twin beds.' Only problem was, -- minutes later, the front desk tried to tell us there were no such rooms. Persistence paid off, and we soon found ourselves in a nice, spacious room on the --th floor. Everything else about the HOB hotel was good. In fact, they wanted to comp us with a Junior Suite after the trouble we were put through, but it didn't have two beds. Points for HOB Hotel. We liked the room decorations and colors, although the voodoo motif might have scared the heck out of kids or a sleepwalker. The room had a great view and floor-to-ceiling windows that actually opened! Excellent air-conditioning. The bathroom was outstanding, as was the maid service. Night-owls will like the opague curtains. The towels were thin, but the shower fine. Doors were solid and elevators efficient. 
The place seemed new and was very clean. No hookers seemed to be hanging around, although there was plentiful scenery in this chic location. The TV reception was poor and number of cable channels small. 
But we didn't go to watch TV so didn't matter. They give you a compiliation blues CD. Rooms have a good little stereo system, so bring your own CDs. The room was spacious, with a desk chair, but no lounge chairs. Nice hassock, though. The downstairs bar, which just won a Chicago magazine poll for best hotel bar, was dead as a doornail Sunday-Monday-Tuesday. But the adjacent House of Blues restaurant-concert hall was hopping. The HOB location is great, just over the Chicago River from the Loop subway stops, meaning you can take a subway from either O'Hare or Midway and walk to the hotel if you're traveling pretty lightly. The river itself is dwarfed by majestic architecture and topped by multiple picturesque bridges, a few blocks away from the site of the ---- Eastland ship disaster that killed --- people (plaque marks the site for history buffs). Besides a friendly Smith & Wollensky next door overlooking the river, the general area is kind of beautiful but kind of dead, so hop on the Red Line to Wrigleyville or just about anywhere in the city (we got a three-day $-- subway-bus pass that we wore out). Back to the hotel--the lobby looks like something out of Marrakesh; this is not your average expensive hotel, perhaps an acquired taste, but I would definitely stay there again. Staff was pretty friendly, location is bedrock Chicago, subway right nearby, and you might get a break on the price through Expedia or other on-line broker; our average cost for Saturday-Sunday-Monday was about $---.

The room service was fast but after the gratuity charges and another surchrage the waitress still lingered about for a tip. I didn't like her.
My room was also not cleaned on my second day because I was in my room the two consecutive times the cleaning lady knocked. I told her to come back in an hour. She didn't. But they were very nice aout bringing the beauty products that weren't restocked as a result of the room not being cleaned up to me very quickly.
I found Phoenix quite small and it was about -- minutes to most points of interest. The hotel was fairly central. Less if I knew my way around a bit. If I were to go again I would get a place closer to Tempe where there was actual life on the streets. If you do decide to stay at this hotel make sure to go to the Chinese Cultural Centre enarby to eat and check out the amazing grocery store.
The only significant shortcoming of the hotel was it's pool.

We had omelets and waffles and turkey sausage, fruits, muffins, bagels etc. The breakfast hostess was very helpful answering questions about the area. The housekeepers came out and greeted all of us before they started work. You could tell they were having fun and enjoying their job.

We'd read that the hotel doesn't have an elevator so we came prepared with a backpack rather than the suitcase and we'd suggest others do the same. The room was a bit small, but hey, from what I hear that's the norm for Manhattan. Importantly though it was clean. We'd also read from the hundreds of other reviews we'd scoured that bed bugs are a big problem in Manhattan (it was actually on the news while we were there!), but we were fine. I did a suspicious check on the night we arrived and there were none to be seen.
The bathroom was excellent - it was very clean. The shower had excellent pressure and stayed at a constant temperature; it was by far one of the best showers we've ever encountered in our hotel travels. The towels were white and fluffy, if a little small.
The noise from outside was no problem. We were expecting it to be very loud but it wasn't at all. The only thing we noticed was the heating system clanked and wheezed a bit - it didn't trouble us but it might annoy others.
The reception staff were very helpful and friendly - we arrived at the hotel very late on the first night (at about midnight) but it was no problem. They also helped us on the last day when there was an error with our airport transfer - thanks again for that!
Finally, another of the hotel's advantages is the location. It's just around the corner from the Empire State Building and Macy's and the --th street subway is only - blocks down for when you want to go elsewhere.

Baltimore Marriott Waterfront
As a comparison point, we were happy with the Courtyard in terms of its cleanliness and great location and see it as a decent option. The hotel is situated on Aliceanna Street near the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Little Italy"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" area. There are quite a number of nice condominiums and hotels nearby as well as some brand name stores such as Haagen-Daas, Starbucks, etc. You have a nice walk (about -- minutes) to the National Aquarium, water taxis and the other amenities nearby. It can get pretty hot during the summer but its manageable. 
Check-in was smooth and the staff were friendly. The lobby was comfortable with the standard """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Courtyard Cafe"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""", an attractive bar area and lounge. Our room was large and very clean with the fourth floor offering balcony views of the harbor and the area skyline. 
The fourth floor is also home to a nicely landscaped patio section complete with an indoor pool and fitness center. It's a rather large space where you face an an adjacent office complex connected to the hotel. It's attractive yet somewhat strange to peer in on folks hard at work during your leisure. 
On the downside, this is not a full-service property so there is no one to help with bags and, if you go on the weekend, a strong possibility of no baggage carts readily available. Our breakfast buffet was comped due to very slow service. The staff also seemed stressed and a little inexperienced. It wasn't a big deal as everyone was nice.
Overall, this hotel is a notch above the standard """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Marriott Courtyard"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" but is notihing fancy. I would rank it as a - --- star and a solid choice despite being a few blocks off the water. We were happy and could see us staying again in the future.",Firefox,Mobile,happy

id10776,"My standard size room was so spacious that it seemed like a suite. The floor to ceiling window covered almost the entire end of the room -- probably -- feet or so in length -- and allowed lots of light in the room, although the room darkening drapes could be pulled when you wanted to block the morning sun. The large bathroom had a vanity-dressing area and a nice marble style counter, with a separate toilet-shower area.
The service was among the best I have received, with extra special touches like having the front desk call my room an hour or so after check in to ask if I was finding everything okay and to ask if I needed anything else. Later when I needed to go to someplace in town, I was offered a private car shuttle on a gratuity only basis, and I was told they would come pick me up when I was ready as well.

The couple of small issues were a lack of drawer space. Travelling with - kids, we really like to unpack and feel organized and there simply was very little drawer space to do this, so we lived out of suit cases. There was plenty of room in the suite for a dresser, but it simply wasn't there. Also, the bathrooms were somewhat lacking for a high end hotel. There is not a lot of counter space and not a seperate room for the toliet. Also, the walls are very thin and I woke up both mornings becasue of people talking outside of my room-it seemed like they were right in our room with us.
Overall, it is a very nice hotel-however, be expecting big and crowded. We had just come from a four seasons in jackson hole, so it took some getting used to.
We were trapped on the runway at the airport because of a bomb threat at the airport. We finally got to the hotel after a long day of travel and the front desk told us that the restaurant at the pool-water park closed at - (it was about -:--) 
We rushed to the pools so the kids could go on the water slides and we could order food-unfortunately, the food service ended at -...so we were out of luck--we were starving and now wet...so we walked to the sports bar-where they told us it would be -- min wait for a table (even though there were a lot of tables open...) so I grabbed the manager, Chelsea, told her our story and she was very helpful and we were seated within minutes. I really appreciated her kindness and attention. Thank you Chelsea for really coming to our rescue! The food was good, service a little slow, but decent.
Prior to our stay-I had called the concierge and asked for recommendations on how to plan our few days at the hotel. She recommended staying on site on saturday because of all the kids activities and heading to Seaworld on Friday.
When we were at the pool on thursday-we asked about booking a cabana for saturday, only to find out they were all booked. This was very frustrating to me for a few reasons-first, in my opinion, if you call and ask for the concierge's advice and they suggest staying on site for a saturday-they should mention the cabana rental. The place was an absolute zoo on saturday. By --am, there were absolutely no chairs left--NONE! line of at least --- guests waiting to get their wrist band to get into the water park. secondly, we were staying in the highest room category on site. At most high end hotels, the guests staying in the highest end rooms are at least offered the ammenties such as a cabana (not for free, just the ability to rent one)...
Thankfully, the concierge manager Donna was wonderful and was able to reserve an end-cap cabana for us and it saved our last day on our vacation. Without that, between the crowds and the heat, it literally would have been miserable. Thank you Donna for your help and understanding.
Honestly, I felt like I was given bad advice by the concierge. The hotel is way over-crowded on the weekend. It is unmanageable and unpleasant. I wish we had gone to seaworld on saturday and stayed at the hotel on fri.
In general, this is a nice, clean hotel. It is just too big for my taste. The crowds were like a vegas hotel. The service was just ok because of the size. We ordered room service every morning and every morning, something was not right.
The water park is great, my kids love waterparks and the slides are big and fun. 
If I were to go back to this hotel, it would certainly not be on a weekend. I wouldn't even consider going on a weekend. Maybe it was because it was the summer...but just crazy.
Also, every time we called the front desk for something, we were on hold for a few minutes.
In short, nice grounds, pretty hotel, clean and big rooms-new, service couldn't keep up with the crowds.
Chelsea and Donna were life savers. They were a highlight of great service during a stay full of very mediocre service.

This hotel tries so hard to be trendy that it is almost uncomfortable. The rooms are some of the smallest I have ever been in. The bed was a single queen and I'm used to a king. I guess I was too cheap to upgrade to a king. Not used to having to do that. The mattress and bedding were truly heavenly.
The glass enclosed shower leaked out the bottom and made the tiny """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""bathroom area"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" very, very slick. I imagine that there must be some horrific falls in that hotel.
On the top of the hotel is an over the top trendy bar and night club that pretends to be super exclusive. Frankly, a lot of the women going in and out of there looked like working girls if you know what I mean. The seating was poor and the menu was sparse (also I'm a vegan and can usually make any menu work, but there was nothing I could do with this one).

Dont pay for the cheapest room, its a -* hotel so naturally if you pay for the cheapest room it will be the smallest and have a poor view, so if you can afford to stay here, make sure you pay a bit extra. There are lots of categories of rooms and two wings to stay in so do a bit of research before booking. Dont not stay here because of the people who complain about the price of food etc, of course its expensive, its a -* hotel, but when in San Francisco why eat-drink away your money in the hotel? There are many great places a few mins walk out the door that offer just as good food for half the price. When I asked the concierge for recommendations on where to eat, he never mentioned their own restaurants which goes to show they do care about your experience in the city as a whole, not just how much you spend at the hotel. There are a lot of reviews that complain about how busy it is, that is never a bad thing.

I picked up my best friend, Sue, in Baltimore and we drove from there to NYC...and the BEAUTIFUL Blue Moon hotel. The hotel has been exquisitely and lovingly renovated by the hotel's owner, Randy. Sue and I both were very impressed with the pure cleanliness of the huge room and luxurious bath. We were in the Sophie Tucker room (all rooms are named after ----s & --s vaudeville stars) and it was perfect for two friends. The daybed was much more comfortable than a pull out sofa and with its high back and ends Sue and I both felt like we had our own space and privacy when it was time to go to bed.
The people who work at the Blue Moon were wonderfully sweet and helpful. In fact, it was my initial phone conversation with (manager?) Antonella, that got me exctied about the hotel and made my decision to stay two nights insted of just one. I am so glad I did. Thank you, Antonella (or Roma as I called you!)

Booked a double double room through Expedia, got an upgrade to a Queen Queen on arrival as we were there to get married. Room was on -th floor, big and spacious with two kingsize beds. Modern furnishings and style, very comfortable. Huge bathroom with big walk in shower all kitted out in black marble, complete with small plasma TV.
Staff were very welcoming, doormen were always ready to help and often a step ahed of the guest (eg ready with a complementary umbrella when it was raining). In fact, when we arrived, the toilet overflowed and there was a maintenance man there within - minutes, who fixed the problem and cleaned up the water. It happened so efficiently that it doesn't even register as a prblem in the memory bank.
Coffee perculator in the room was very welcome - NB creamer and sugar IS supplied (contrary to what another reviewer says) it's all in the gold packet with the coffee sachet! Chocs on turn-down were lovely (plus the next day's weather forecast)
My only gripe would be that the wardrobe (closet) is way too small - well not so much the closet space itself, but the area within it given over to hanging space. Just about enough for - person if that, but lots of drawer space.
Yes, it would have been nice to have a bar in the hotel, but there is no need for a breakfast room when the Manhattan Diner is about -- steps away and open --hours (breakfasts are huge, tasty and very reasonable - never more than $-- for two people and that was the day we had smoked salmon!)
The area is great - loads of restaurants and shops on Broadway and Amsterdam. Fab delis in the area (Westend Market and Zabars). Great pubs-bars up the road on Amsterdam (Dead Poet and George Keeleys are recommended).
Subway was either at --th street (less than - mins walk) or --nd Street - about -- mins away. Neighbourhood felt very safe, even walking around past midnight. Loads of cabs on Broadway or Amsterdam Ave.
- blocks to museums and central park, half hour stroll to Columbus Circle.

Pros-
-. Good location.
-. Good restaurants. --grille was superb.
-. Great front desk service (as expected from Westin).
-. Nicely appointed room & bath.
-. Ok gym and small indoor pool.
-. Nice, albeit expensive, spa services.
-. Friendly hotel bar-good drinks.
Cons-
-. Cost of parking.. On the day of our departure I called the front desk inquiring about the valet service and if we would be charged for another full day if we went to lunch before requesting our car. They assured us this would be no problem, but low and behold my c-c is showing $--. That means we paid an extra $-- for - hr and would have taken our car out sooner if we had know. Really disappointed and hoping to resolve this with the hotel.
-. The hostess at Roast was pretty rude-disinterested. We are from NYC and used to having to wait for a table. She quoted us -.- hrs without even looking up from her station. She then recommended (again without looking up) that we sit at the bar, so I walked around the corner and mentioned it was full which she basically repeated back to me. It really turned us off to even eating there, for one of the highest recommended restaurants in Detroit one would expect great service and a friendly atmosphere... Alas.

Our room was average sized but had new furnishings, quality bathroom fixtures and a comfortable bed (however I prefer the new beds found at Marriott and Westin).

id10893,"Marriott LAX - --.--.--
 This is a typical large Marriott hotel with all the services you expect. It is very close to the airport terminals, but current arrangements with airport shuttles mean it may take longer to reach the hotel door than you would like. This, plus new LAX security policy, which apparently prohibits walking to and from the area, means that even though you are literally next to the airport, you should plan on more time to get to your room or meeting than you would have in the past.
 Otherwise, we experienced no problems with this property. 
As mentioned in other reviews, the rooms are alarmingly small for such a hotel, reminding one of some of the old New York City hotels that were converted from really old properties but kept the small room sizes. Given prices near the airport, it might pay to shop around for a hotel with more living space if you are going to spend more than a night there. Within a quarter mile of the terminals, there are lots of top hotels to choose from.
 If you are not a frequent visitor to LAX, you should also prepare yourself for the airport’s abysmal conditions and expect it to take you maybe twice as long to negotiate outbound departures. Security procedures are closer to those in third world airports and the domestic and international terminal areas are well behind those in some other major USA airports and disorganized, despite the waves of TSA (read as “Thousands Standing Around”), personnel shuttling your checked baggage from one place to another. The absurdity of the three stage international departure exercise challenges both logic and patience as you must first check in with the airline, then physically carry your checked baggage to the TSA X-Ray point which is always backed up and understaffed, then go and get in line a third time for the usual mindless check of your carry-on and person. This routine may also include undue harassment from private security personnel at various locations. 
 Plan at least three hours for portal to portal, hotel front door to airline gate, to be safe. 
 Still, the hotel is convenient if you must be in or go through LAX and sometimes you have little choice. If you arrive there from overseas, prepare yourself for long waits, first at immigration and then at customs. Returning from Japan, we spent two hours after we got our luggage getting through US government check points. Private security personnel were the rudest encountered in many years anywhere, so again, prepare yourself for “The LAX Treatment.”

I can't say enough about the beds, they were absolutely amazing, just ridiculously large and comfortable. Every time I went anywhere near the bed I just had to get in it! 
My only problem with this place was the size of the room. To use the bathroom I had to sit on the toilet, scrunch my legs and then close the door.

The air conditioning works and was easily adjustable; although noisy it isn't as noisy as a cheap motel. Although it is right next to the freeway and I could see the traffic go by, the soundproofing stopped it from being a problem. The grab-and-go breakfast is adequate; bagels, muffins, juice, coffee, apples and oranges.

We knew we didn't need five-star luxury, just a place to sleep, but were pleasantly surprised by a hotel that is clean, relaxing, and has very comfortable beds. The yellow hallways give the hotel a happy vibe, and the bathrooms are done in white tile that didn't have me questioning the cleanliness. The hotel has free WiFi, unlike some other local hotels that charge you. We had breakfast in the cafeteria downstairs and were happy with the good price and convenience.
The hotel is about --- feet from Back Bay Station on the Orange line, which was very convenient for taking Amtrak in, and about a quarter mile from Copley on the Green line.

 Other tips for travellers to NY:
Downtown = South
Book tickets on the internet in advance for EVERYTHING to save some time queueing and beware long lines in peak periods. Pay attention to security requirements.

id10965,"What an excellent hotel. We can't find a single thing to criticise about this place.
The location is perfect - less than a block from Times Square but still quite quiet. The street outside is a little bit rough but not threatening in any way.
The hotel itself is on the small side, and all the better for it. The staff are friendly and helpful; the lobby welcoming, rooms clean and beautifully decorated (and ours had a bath), delicious contintental breakfast, free wine and beer happy hour every day.

id10968,"When we made arrangements to attend a function at the nearby Smart Center, the business manager suggested this hotel as convenient to their location (and all the other dealerships on --th). It was also very reasonably priced. So I called to verify vacancies for the date we would need a room, and the room rate. I was disappointed to hear that there were no king sized beds- (so we booked a full-queen), and there was no room service available. I was pleased that the room rate was so low (I haven't stayed in a hotel for less than $-- since people were break dancing in parachute pants!) and I was happy to hear that there was a pizza place that delivered to the hotel and there were several nice restaurants nearby, so I made the reservation.
A few days later, I realized I had not received my confirmation email. So, to be """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""on the safe side"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" (read, because my other half insisted), I called to make sure we had a room reserved. It was a good thing I did (read, yes, she was right) because there was no record of my reservation in their computer, and we did not have a room reserved, despite my phone reservation. The hotel manager was apologetic, and quickly booked our room for the original quoted rate and sent me an email confirmation.
The night we checked in, the GPS eventually got us to the hotel, but using the GPS we had to drive through a residential subdivision. Ordinarily, this would not be a big deal, but this particular neighborhood has the largest speed bumps running across the road that I have ever seen. Seriously, who needs speed bumps nearly a foot high? Who needs speed bumps a foot high every -- feet for a quarter of a mile? After slowly dragging the underside of our car over the third or fourth speed bump, and gritting our teeth to the sound of metal and plastic grinding against these asphalt speed humps from hell, I decided to turn back and find an alternate route. The GPS found one- by going only one block further, and it took us directly to the hotel parking lot- without any speed bumps... 
We arrived at --:--pm (we had changed time zones on the drive), and the clerk quickly got us checked in. We were disappointed to learn however, that all of the nearby restaurants, bar and grill places, even the fast food joints, cater specifically to the nearby businesses and as a result, all of them, and I mean all of them, closed at - or --pm. Because it was a week night, even the pizza place closed early. In short, there are only - places within several miles to get any sort of food in this area after --pm- Mc D's, or BurgerK. So, after hours of driving, we had to get back in the car and head out for a paper sack full of drive-thru, deep fried, greasy grub, and a couple of """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""cokes.""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
As for the room, the room itself was small, but not as small as some of the hotel rooms I've stayed in, our room was probably around -- x --. The kitchenette is open to the room and there is a small table separating the spaces. There is not enough room for a sofa, but there was a recliner parked in the corner. There was nothing in the room that wasn't functional or appeared to be heavily used or dirty. The ac appeared to be newer, and worked fine. The room was very clean, but appeared somewhat dated. We did not use the appliances, except for the refrigerator and the coffee maker- both of which worked fine (the coffee was awful however-bring your own if you can). The bathroom was very clean and it had a full size tub with a shower. The water pressure was good, and there were no problems with temp fluctuations during bathing. Oddly, there was no shampoo in the shower, and when we noticed this the next morning we remembered that a guest came down while we were checking in to get shampoo. Maybe shampoo is provided upon request or something like ketchup at the McD's drive thru?... The bed was very firm (I had no problem, but the wife didn't sleep well because it was too firm for her). The pillows were the typical synthetic, non-allergic spun polyester type (which should make all of the asthmatics in your party giggle with glee) but if you use just one pillow, your head will sink to the mattress, (which I suppose could also be an issue for stomach sleepers...)
The next morning, We looked out the window to find the parking lot nearly completely empty, and commented on the fact that we never heard any sounds from outside of our room. With the exception of the repeated, high pitched, angry screaming and squeals of someone's precious little darling outside our door """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""No!, I want the ...(something or other)"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" as we packed up to check out, we never heard anything from the adjoining rooms or the hallway. So noise was generally not a problem.
Checkout was easy, and took all of twenty seconds. We were not disappointed with the hotel for the amount it cost for us to stay there. We probably will not stay there again, because we honestly don't really have a reason to return to the area. I think for a business professional who doesn't have an expense account, and isn't reimbursed by his or her crooked employer for overnight stays in this area however, it would be a good, inexpensive option, as long as you are able to hit the nearby restaurants before -pm, you double check your reservation, bring your own pillow, coffee and shampoo and you don't expect the four seasons or the fairmont for $--.",Edge,Mobile,happy

I was expecting a small room after reading some reviews here but i was a bit surprised to see how 'big' it was, it surely was big enough for - people. Enough space to store multiple suitcases near the coat rack. Room was spotless & clean. Bed's were nice, clean and comfortable. Shower was nice, always warm water. The airconditioning worked fine although we didnt had to use it very much due to the bad weather. Every day there was maid service. In the room there's a TV with Fox, NBC, CNN, Weather Channel and some other channels, there's a coffee machine next to the TV, a hairdryer in the bathroom. I once forgot my mobile phone but at the end of the day it was still there. Always felt safe while staying at the hotel. There's also always someone from the staff present at the desk in the lobby.
Location: nice and safe neighborhood and within a half minute walk of the subway #- [walk towards Park Ave then towards --nd Street] which can bring you uptown to Grand Central Terminal [one stop] or downtown all the way to Union Square Station, Chinatown and lower Manhattan. Within three blocks of the hotel there are enough places to buy food like two Duane Reade's [supermarket], Starbucks, deli at the corner, Subway, Dunkin Donuts [on the corner of --st & Park Ave], McDonalds and it's like --- blocks or so from the Empire State Building, -th Avenue and other shopping locations [i.e. Manhattan Mall, Macy*s]. Location is very good so to speak.
After check-out you can leave your luggage for free in their storage room which you have to collect within -- hours. Hotel staff arranged us a ride back to JFK airport with a fixed rate! So we didnt had to hail a yellow cab. Price was $-- including tip and toll. So ask them about this as a yellow cab won't use a flat rate like when you're travelling from JFK to Manhattan. Even with trafficjams it only took like a hour to get from the hotel to JFK.
Last thing, although we had a private bathroom, we always noticed when leaving the hotel in the morning or coming back at night that the shared bathroom was always available so if you have thoughts about having to wait in line when making a reservation for a room with a shared bathroom.. this surely ain't the case.

Here're the major pros & cons (not many):
Pros:
-. Spacious suite & really nice bathroom (though could use more counter space & places to hang extra towels or clothes).
-. Daily NYT, including the weekend's. Do not remember if we choose this preference? It was great to have. There were also other papers in the lobby every morning.
-. Heated outdoor pool: there were plenty of towels and seating, though I expect it'll be much busier during summer.
-. Morning coffee & tea bar: it was very well supplied & well maintained.
-. On Sat evening we got a call about printing Boarding Passes for Sun's flights. This is such a nice reminder service, and it was easy to use the Concierge kiosk to print.
-. Valet service was always prompt & helpful. One day I even asked them to get a relative's car when I didn't have the ticket number, I gave them guest name & car description and that was enough. 
There have been a lot of TripAdvisor discussions of the valet daily charge, we used it and felt it's worthwhile. while some relatives chose to park on the streets which have plentiful free parking esp during Sat-Sun.
-. Staff all very helpful & courteous, from Reception-Valet-Housekeeping-restaurant.
-. Fitness room wasn't cramped and had a partial view, very clean & well stocked with towels. BLVD --'s private room(s) were perfect for groups.
Cons: 
-. We requested an in-room coffeemaker but it was not delivered in time.
For late sleepers it'd be nice to have a morning hot drink in the room.

 First is location -- it's extremely convenient to the airport and most of the attractions as well. There is also a Trader Joes and Vons within less than a half mile -- almost walking distance. The location on the esplanade park and walkway is wonderful, with bayfront-estuary views and a huge walking-biking pathway right outside the door and a huge park there too. Its in a quiet safe neighborhood with the only sound disturbances being the planes taking off, because of the proximity to the airport. 
 The rooms have a nice almost full kitchen -- full size fridge, dishwasher, microwave, - burner range and no oven. There is a nice large granite type counter area that is very convenient for food preparation and a small dining table with - chairs in our one bedroom unit. There's a nice little balcony with one chair on it -- for a little reading or coffee in the sunshine. There are two LG flatscreen TVs -- one in the living room and one in the bedroom that are quite adequate. The fold out couch in the living room is smallish and the cushions are showing some age related compression, but it was still comfortable. There's a worktable with ergonomic chair and easy web access stuff and outlets that are efficient and comfortable. The bed linens are soft and comfortable, there are a wide variety of pillows available. The toilet paper is Cottonelle -- so it's nice and soft, not the single ply sandpaper stuff that many places are trying to offer now, and the toiletries are very nice Neutrogena products. 
 The business center computers are antiquated and slow and pretty much only useful for printing out boarding passes. The laundry is large and bright with plenty of machines that are modern and do a good job. My husband enjoyed the exercise equipment that included a treadmill, elliptical, stationary bike, free weights and a weight machine - drinking fountains and a TV were available in the workout room. 
The gardens and outdoor areas were extensive, well landscaped and maintained.. There was quite a variety of outdoor seating available, with many areas having gas fireplaces in the seating areas. There were several outdoor grills available for guest use that were modern, clean and ready to go. 
The breakfast and dinner offerings are adequate - but not gourmet. You get hot filling food, but it's just kind of average. Standard make your own waffles, bagels, english muffins, etc, - three """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""hot offerings"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" which usually are eggs, sausage and tater tots -- the best of which is the tater tots, and a fruit and yogurt bar that has canned peaches, canned mandarins, cottage cheese and yogurt, and some fresh melon chunks. Evening offerings are a nice enough salad bar, and a hot offering that has been during our stay - edible, but mostly because it's included. There's drinkable wine and beer and with the nice pool table and fireplace area, it offers a nice opportunity to unwind after the day. 
I found the staff to be friendly and responsive, even when our flight was delayed. The cleaning staff is polite, unobtrusive and efficient.
The hotel offers very good rates, with nice discounts for government and AAA and they participate in the HH points program. It is a family oriented hotel, so there will be kids at breakfast, in the pool, etc.... and, of course, their behavior is up to their parents ... but we had no problem with noise. 
Overall - the best place to stay in SanDiego if you're not looking for night life, excitement etc. If you want a great convenient location, nice facilities, large room, kitchen facilities, and the open air experience -- with just a few minutes to the zoo, SeaWorld, Balboa park, airport and downtown -- no parking fees, no internet fees, and a safe place where you and your kids can stretch out and run around....

We read every review and decided we owed it to everyone to give our review. If you land on The Barclay, you are in for a treat!
We spent a week (Spring Break) at this fabulous hotel and have just returned.
Getting there: First, you have many options, and you can spend -- bucks for a taxi, or, take the Air Train from JFK. A family of -, with luggage, we found the Air Train to be safe and easy. Best of all $-.-- per person will land you just a short walk (- blocks) to the Barclay. Total time is about an hour at -:-- am on a Saturday Morning. The help with directions at the Air Train Terminal is fantastic. The folks are patient and nice.
At the Barclay: We arrived early and knew our room would not be ready, but tried. I had emailed in advance and told the Guest Services it was a special occasion. To our delight, we were upgraded to a Designer Suite. We checked our bags ($-) each and did some touring of NYC.
The Room: Wow, the wait was worth it. We had a HUGE Bedroom and Sitting Room. The furniture is ultra modern, Bose Radio in the bedroom, Large TV, Refrigerator, and a well-stocked mini-bar. Check the prices first. We walked across the street and had two great Deli's to choose from, everything from A-Z.
The bed, wow, what a super night's sleep! We turned the fan on and used the 'white noise' to drown out the crazy horn-honking of NYC drivers. You will love the comfortable beds and the great pillows.
The staff even does turn down service and does a light make-over, replacing towels, and making the room ready for your return from an evening out. The chocalates are yummy! Of course check out the in-room breakfast choices. A Regular juice, eggs, toast, meat, and coffee is $--. There are too many options within walking distance, unless, of course you have a ton of cash.
Staff-Check-in was a great experience, many people there to help you out. Melissa was awesome! Everyone was friendly. House Security quickly found a bag my wife left in the lobby, after a frantic walk from downtown. Only one Bellman was not friendly, the rest went out of their way to help us. Concierege Staff is knowledgeable and mosthelpful.
Location: Just around the corner is an underground walkway to Grand Central Terminal. You take the Northwest Passage way next to the trains and you are --- feet from the hotel entrance. We walked from Broadway and Times Square a lot, sometimes skipping the convenent """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""S"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" Train from Times Square to Grand Central. The Barclay is a convenient and excellent location. One day we had to rush to meet some friends at the Empire State Building. Taxi fare was $-.--. So, if you are in a hurry, taxis are a great value to make that curtain time. 
Ambience: Beautiful flowers at the entrance and a HUGE live flower ordains the lobby. Comfortable and stylish furniture make the lobby a great place to wait or 'people watch'. The atmosphere is upscale but not pretentious. Everything from jeans to designer suits were being worn.
If you want a super clean, upscale, larger than normal rooms,. Make the Barclay your place to stay!",Internet Explorer,Mobile,happy

For families they have an on site water park complete with slides, lazy river pool, cabanna's etc. The rooms were very nice and there were a few restaurants on site. 
We had an opportunity to eat at the Steak House, -- Oaks which is loctaed on the golf course and it was exceptional. It is somewhat pricey but worth every penny. They also have a large sports bar-restaurant with numerous beers on tap and decent bar food. Another on site restaurant is the Cibolo Moon which is open for breakfast, lunch and dinner and we ate there on a few occassions and must say it was also very good. I also thought the prices were fair for the type of property the resort is. 
The only draw back to staying at this property is that you need a car as there is nothing within walking distance so therefore yo have to drive. To take a cab into san Antonio too see the Riverwalk or the Alamo it is a SIXTY DOLLAR cab fare one way. The hotel does not have a shuttle and I do not think that they are planning on getting one as they want you to stay and spend your money at the resort.

id11048,"I've stayed in at least a dozen hotels in San Francisco within walking distance of the Palomar. Most cost a little less. For me, the slightly higher rate for the Palomar was worth it. 
It's not a true luxury hotel, so don't go there expecting something extraordinary; if you're content with a basic, comfortable room, you can find many at a lower rate. But at the Palomar, my room was definitely larger than average. Although I don't spend a lot of time in my hotel rooms, over a period of several days a small room can feel cramped. The bed was fine, the decor was understated and classy. Everything was clean. Flat screen TV with DVD player, mp--player clock radio, mini bar, bathrobes and umbrella in the closet along with an iron, selection of good newspapers. The bathroom was average--nothing remarkable, but no problems with the shower or anything else (not always the case in my experience; sometimes showers are cramped, or the shower head is too low, or the water turns hot and cold by itself). I was on the seventh floor, and although the windows were covered by plate plexiglass, which dampened exterior noise from the busy street below, I could hear an occasional honk or dumpster routine in the middle of the night. But it was relatively quiet; I've been to many hotels in the area at which dumpsters being emptied in the middle of the night have made sleep impossible; not so here. It has a free wine hour in the evening.
The location--around the corner from Market Street--is a matter of personal preference. It's a short walk to Union Square, but there are many hotels a few blocks closer. I always use the BART, so I liked having the station a minute from the hotel, instead of ten minutes.
I was particularly impressed by the service. Each and every one of the people I dealt with at the front desk was extremely helpful as well as friendly. I got a good recommendation for a breakfast place nearby, and the staff person called to make sure it was serving before I walked over. I had a problem with my check at the hotel bar (under separate management) and the hotel took care of it without any hassle at all. I The doorman always wished me a nice day and asked if I wanted transportation, but he was never pushy. The room was cleaned unobtrusively. These are all things we should expect, but just don't always happen, so when everything works, I think it's worth mentioning.

Since the hotel was nowhere near capacity during our stay (in fact is was empty the first --- nights), the casual cafe-coffee shop was not open for breakfast. Only the main dining room was open. When a conference group came in during our -th day there, they opened all the restaurants. We really did not utilize the dining options.

Concierge helped us navigate our way on bus routes, and helped my husband figure out a problem with his Stubhub tickets for the Cubs game.
Getting around town from the Doubletree was easy, and we were Chicago newbies. The bus stop we used most often was - blocks away. We were close enough to walk the whole way to Navy Pier. We parked our van at InterPark, which is just across the street from Doubletree and significantly cheaper than the hotel lot. We could see our car from our hotel window. Very easy walk to Dominick's grocery store (bought our visitor bus passes there), ----, West Egg Cafe, Baskin Robins ice cream. Everything you need is nearby.
The room was clean, had - queen size beds, and bathroom was fine. Room had ironing board and hair dryer. We were advised at check-in to move the snack tray (with computer sensors on it) up high so our kids wouldn't fool with it, causing charges to the room. When my husband tried to move the tray up high, all the snacks fell off and we were worried we would be charged for everything! The front desk clerk was understanding, and said it was no problem. This must happen often...
The rooftop pool was nice, had plenty of chairs and towels, and was the perfect relaxation spot after our long days of sightseeing. Kids thought it was cool to swim on the rooftop surrounded by all the buildings of Chicago. An unexpected bonus: We could see the Wednesday night Navy Pier fireworks from the rooftop pool area. 
We did not want to pay $-- extra to have a refrigerator in the room, so we brought our own cooler with drinks, some kid snacks, and a gallon of milk. This way, we could eat a quick breakfast in the room (single-serve cereal bowls and some fruit) before heading out for our activities. Saved money and more convenient, and we just refilled the cooler with the hotel ice machine when needed.
This hotel was perfect for our needs, the location was great, staff were friendly, and the price was right. We did not have trouble with elevators. There are - elevators running at all times, and though we were on the --nd floor, we never felt like the elevators were slowing us down at all.

And the staff mentioned our anniversary at check-in and we found a gift waiting for us in the room. Nice touch!
Our room was clean and fairly spacious (king premiere is what I believe they called it). We had a king bed and a sitting area with a couch and chair. The floor to ceiling mirrors were an """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""interesting"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" touch. ;)

And trash pick up one morning and normal motorcycle-car traffic sounds were pretty loud. But having stayed in big cities before - it's kind of normal.

id11114,"For all those fellow travelers who are tired of airports and the eternal stresses that have developed around simply taking a plane ride, you will find tremendous solace in a small island of tranquility at the Grand Hyatt DFW Airport.
On a recent trip to Ixtapa-Zihuatanejo, Mexico, we were traveling through DFW from Washington DC. Due to forecasted snow on our day of departure, American Airlines cancelled our outbound flight and they re-booked us so that we over-nighted, at our expense though, in Dallas in order to catch the one-day-a-week flight to Ixtapa.
You should note that there are two Hyatt hotels at DFW. In terminal C is the Hyatt Regency DFW and in terminal D is the Grand Hyatt. We decided to choose the Grand Hyatt given that our plane was due to leave from this very same terminal. To our surprise, the Grand Hyatt is a stunning hotel even superior to any city hotel in which we have stayed let along the reputation of “airport” hotels.
In the event that you arrive at any other terminal, there are regular (free) airport shuttles that will take you to the Grand Hyatt in terminal D. For starters, once one collects their bags in terminal D, it is a very easy walk and an escalator ride to the elevators to the Hyatt. What struck me as we approached the hotel elevators was that the American Airlines check-in (for our following day departure) could not have been more than -- steps away with the security area literally adjacent to it. Nothing like rolling out of bed and checking-in for your flight!
Exiting the hotel elevator, you will be presented with a well appointed lobby to your left and to your right a very attractive bar and restaurant. This hotel also offers conference facilities that are rather impressive. Our west facing room was a suite on the sixth floor that was spacious with a living room and very large bedroom. The décor is modern and minimalist with a very fancy lighting and (electric) blind-curtain system. The standard amenities are all included. Yet, a peculiarity was noted that we never experienced: you have to call the reception so that they can deliver a coffee maker-pot for the room. This is very odd. Although the rooms are well insulated and may be stating the obvious, you will hear some noise of the departing aircrafts even if they may not be using the runways in front of terminal D. Yet, traffic subsides significantly after --pm. 
A quick tour of the property is worth it not just to familiarize oneself, but to appreciate the many amenities. Aside from the expansive conference facilities and business center, it has a very good fitness center, outdoor pool and sun deck. Features that I am sure would come in handy when staying during warmer months. The restaurant is very large and attractive. We have a very tasty breakfast the following morning.

Anyway, this was no problem and we were swiftly moved to a Deluxe (Corner) room.
The room is lovely and large, with huge windows on two sides overlooking Coit Tower in one direction and towards Nob Hill in the other. The room was decorated in soothing grey-blues and neutral tones, and was truly a relaxing and pleasant place to be and wake up every morning. The bed was large and comfortable and the room was equipped with a soft seating area in one corner, a table with four chairs and a huge desk area - nothing had been overlooked. The entrance lobby was large enough to accommodate an extra bed for our - year old which worked great as it felt like she had an area separate to ours. The table and chairs was a fantastic bonus, as we were able to comfortably enjoy take-outs when getting over jetlag and not feeling like eating out. The bathrrom was large with a floor to ceiling window (which let in lots of light but it was rather disconcerting to sit on the loo overlooking the buildings opposite!!). Unfortunately our room did not have a bath, just a large walk in shower. We did not notice this until after the bell boy had left us, and did not have the heart to complain again, due in no small part to the room being so fantastic in every other way. 
The breakfast included was good with plenty of choice of cereal and dried fruits, yoghurts, toast, muffins etc and a small selection of cooked items. We had to pay extra for our small daughter but this amounted to probably $-- a day including tip, so we didn't mind too much as we were getting a good deal overall. We didn't eat in the restaurant-sports bar, but it looked busy and buzzing when we passed. 
The pool area is nice, although in April the heated pool was not heated enough to compensate for the rather chilly air, but no matter.
Overall this was one of my favourite hotels during our trip to the US. We were once loyal Fairmont guests, but decide to forego the opportunity to stay there on this trip to San Francisco.

id11145,"Stayed - night in room ---. 
Spacious, well furnished room including microwave. Lots of parking available. 
Not exactly “downtown”, but a free shuttle service is provided to get into town which is convenient. Cheap cab ride back, although it is walkable. 
Guest self-service laundry facilities provided - $- per load to wash and an extra $- per load to dry. There is only one washing machine and one dryer however. Other facilities include vending machines and the pool-spa area appeared well maintained although we didn’t use it. 
Breakfast is pretty basic and served with plastic plates and cutlery however it did the job.
They have “happy hour” in the afternoons where you get - free drinks and nibbles. I was mortified though when my red wine was served cold!
Some of the staff were helpful, some not so much. We had an issue with the prepayment of the room through a third party website which could have been dealt with better but overall this hotel is very good for a Houston visit.",InternetExplorer,Desktop,happy
id11146,"Stayed at the Omni for two nights on business travel. From the moment I arrived when the valet picked up my car, to the moment I departed when the valet returned my car, I experienced nothing but great customer service from Omni's staff. A first I was skeptical, thinking that the staff was being nice to perhaps make up for less adequate rooms, but when I opened the door to my room, I found it to be clean, comfortable and modern. No dust or crumbs around the baseboards. The mattress was high and firm. The sheets were white and the beds were decorated with accent pillows. The bathroom featured a separate shower and tub, complimentary toilettries and clean, white shower rugs. I also used the fitness center and was impressed with the number and condition of the cardio machines. Most hotels have one or two machines that are terribly outdated. The fitness center at the Omni was spacious and featured elliptical machines, treadmills with mini tvs, and some machine and free weights. The free weights were a little on the old side, but the overall fitness room was more than what I expected. Further, the Omni has a courtesy car that can take you to any business location in the city! I definitely recommend the Omni if service, cleanliness and amenities are of importance to you.",Edge,Desktop,happy
id11148,"Loved the hotel and its location! We're a family of six, and picking a hotel is always a delicate balancing act. We need enough room where we don't drive each other crazy but it also needs to be relatively affordable. The Affinia Dumont was perfect for our --night holiday stay in NYC. We had a --bedroom skyline suite with - queen beds in the bedroom and a pull-out sofa in the living room. Beautiful view of the city, including the Chrysler Building. 
The suite had a roomy foyer-like area at its entry-way which was great for the keeping of our shoes and boots. There was also a really nice dresser - closet - dressing area in the bedroom area outside of the bathroom that was great for keeping our suitcases, dirty clothes, and collection of jackets out of our way. 
The kitchen was set off in a little room by itself, which I really liked. It was very small but had everything you could need - full size refrigerator, toaster, microwave, decent-size sink, coffee maker, gas (!!) stovetop with oven, dishwasher, and lots of drawer and cupboard space. It was also stocked with silverware, plates, bowls, cups, glasses, a couple of pots, and a frying pan. There was service for four and we needed more; we requested more and they quickly stocked it with service for six for us. 
The bathroom was surprisingly roomy and had plenty of shelf space for all our things - a typical one over the sink area and then another deep one on another wall. Water pressure in the shower was good, but like in a lot of hotels, the water fluctuated between very, very cool and very, very warm.
The staff were all particularly competent and friendly - from before our trip down right through the time we (sadly) had to leave. Check-in was quick and efficient, and the bellman (Donald, I believe) was super welcoming and helpful. The front desk manager David was very helpful in planning our stay, and housekeeping did a great job every day.
We fully utilized a number of the hotel's offerings - kitchen (in its entirety!), the pillow menu, the bathrobes, the telescope (requested with the skyline suite), the DVD player (that was brought up within ~- minutes of our request!), the steam shower, the fitness room, the strengthening kit - and truly appreciated them. I booked the room through the Affinia website and had a lot of fun with their My Affinia - My Concierge.
The hotel has recently been renovated, and they did a terrific job. Everything was very nice and tastefully done. Both rooms had large flat-screen TVs. Beds were very comfortable, and down pillows were plentiful. We were on the --th floor and had no problems whatsoever with the elevators. We found them to be quite speedy - both in arrival time and travel time. Lobby is relatively small but inviting and seemingly comfortable - there were always people in it on their computers. We didn't use it, so I can't say how the internet service is.
The Murray Hill location is a joy. In the past, we've tended to stay in the Theater District, but I greatly preferred staying in Murray Hill. I like that it has more of a neighborhood feel but it's still so convenient to anyplace you'd want to go. We easily walked all over - to and from Times Square and Broadway a couple of times, to Grand Central, back from the American Museum of Natural History, up to and through Central Park (all the way up to --th St). If you don't like walking that much or the weather is bad, the closest subway station is just a little over a block away. 
There are a lot of parking lots right around the hotel. The hotel offered to valet park for us for $-- - -- hours, but we didn't mind finding parking on our own. The first one we tried (right across the street) was full, the second one we tried didn't want to take our minivan, but the third one worked out (for $-- - -- hours - a great rate for the city). So be patient - there are enough around that you'll get a spot.
While the Murray Hill deli on the corner is nice for grabbing one or two things, there's a great grocery store (D'Agostino's) right around the corner (-rd Ave and --th St). We also really enjoyed eating lunch at the close-by Banc Cafe on -rd Ave and --th St - very low-key and relaxing atmosphere, excellent food and service. If you like Indian food, """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Curry Hill"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" is just a few blocks down on Lexington. We had planned to eat down there one night, but time got away from us and we didn't get to. Next time. We had Christmas breakfast at the hotel-affiliated Barking Dog, and that was great too.
We just got home last night, and I've already highly recommended the hotel to several people. My entire family felt extremely comfortable, and we are looking forward to going back. 
This hotel is a real gem in the city, and I'm so grateful that we stumbled upon it in particular and the Affinia group in general.

There are -- floors with about -- rooms per floor (based on the -th floor plan). Our stay was comfortable, price was within our budget (under $--- per day with taxes) and we liked the location of the hotel. In terms of safety the front of the hotel is well lit. We returned to the hotel after midnight two nights and felt totally safe as there were still a lots of people on the street. Did not try any of the amenities at the hotel but seemed as though a lot of people were at the bar in the evenings.
The only gripe(not a big one) I had was that even with - elevators we had to wait (occasionally) for the elevator for some considerable amounts of time. Seemed as though room service, maintenance and housekeeping were also using the same elevators (should add that none of the staff got on the elevators if customers were waiting for the elevators, which was courteous of them).
Location: This hotel is one block away from the Empire State building and walking distance to Times Square (about - blocks), Rockefeller Center (about -- blocks), MoMA and Broadway shows. 
Subway: The Herald Square Station is right next to the hotel for the N,Q,R,B,D,F and M subway lines. Penn Station (-th Ave and --th street) is two blocks away and you can get on A,C,E and -,- and - subway lines. We took line - from Penn Station to the South Ferry Station for Battery Park and Statue of Liberty tour. These stations are convenient to to go Uptown or Downtown on the West side

Getting There: We took the E train from Penn Station to Jamaica Ave Station and switched to the Airtrain for JFK with two big boxes (during non-peak hours) and it was pretty easy.

id11165,"Before I begin my review, I want to say that this hotel's service and facilities were MUCH nicer than One Washington Circle, where I had stayed for two days before arriving at this hotel. The decor of the Washington Terrace Hotel is much nicer and the staff is friendlier and more helpful.
When I first arrived at the hotel, the bellmen were slow to help us with our bags, by the time he came out of the lobby, we were already at the door. Right inside another woman was loudly complaining that she had stayed at very nice hotels before and that this hotel's concierge was the worst she had ever encountered. Not a very good first impression! However, I had no problems with the concierge when I asked the to help me find a restaurant I wanted to go to for lunch.
I came back to check in and the only front desk agent on duty was on the phone. I waited patiently then remarked that it must be difficult to both answer phones and serve at the person checking guests into the hotel. (I sympathize with hotel employees since I am a student in hotel administration and have worked in line level positions as well) He agreed and then proceeded to look up my reservation. The Deluxe King room I had requested was unavailable, and he asked if I would mind a stand-up shower. I wasn't sure what he meant, I thought he meant a room with shower stall only. I asked if I could switch rooms the next day if unhappy and he said with a wink that of course I could, but I wouldn't want to since it was a very nice room. 
Turns out he had upgraded us to a suite with a full living room with pull-out couch, two televisions, marble wetbar, HUGE bathroom with marble flooring, a beautiful shower curtain, and well lit bathroom counter area. According to the hotel website I thought all the beds were Tempur-Pedic, this bed was not, but had a very comfortable pillow top mattress and tons of pillows. 
Housekeeping did a great job, everything looked great. I really liked the small details like the Bath & Body Works products in the bathroom and how the housekeeping arranged a small fan on the edge of the bathtub.

First, we went to this hotel for a one night romantic getaway- we recently got married, but havent had time for a honeymoon so it was just a brief getaway from our house which is probably only - miles away. The Westin provided a great escape. Here's a breakdown of the things I noticed.
-The lobby is huge, with a modern decor, and a open lobby bar. However despite being a very modern theme, the use of live birch trees, dark wood, and vibrant art makes it feel comfortable and not cold. This is not your typical Boston hotel, and that is one of the reasons I wanted to stay here.
- Our room was the standard size and for Boston, I have to say it was quite large. The bathroom was unremarkable, although the mirror was fantastic- it was surrounded by a light making it easy for putting on makeup, etc. The TV was a LG -- inch HD, and the picture and sound were fantastic. The selection of channels was better than most hotel rooms, and most channels were in HD. Our view was actually pretty great even though we didn't pay for a room with a view- it is an interesting perspective of Boston from that location, and we enjoyed just watching our city. The window was the entire wall. The furnishings in the room continue the modern but almost nature-feel with warm, earthy tones. The heavenly bed was, as always, heavenly.
-The workout facility was spotless with all brand new equipment. The treadmills were far better than at my own gym. The pool was small, but clean, and the hot-tub was, strangely, metal.
-Dining- we had drinks in the Birch Bar in the lobby- expensive cocktails, but the friendly bartender gave us a round for free. We had the Sea Salt french fries and they were soooo good. You get to choose a few sauces that come from the restaurant, Sauciety. I definitely recommend the Whiskey Spiked Ketchup. We ate dinner and breakfast in the room. Dinner was actually great, and for room-service in Boston, reasonably priced. Breakfast on the other hand, was the downside. VERY expensive ($-- for the standard American Breakfast). The eggs were watery and weird, and the pancakes were salty. It was included in our rate, so we werent that dissapointed. 
-Service. We had simply outstanding service all around. My husband mentioned that we were there for a special occassion, and when we returned to our room from the Birch Bar, we found a bottle of expensive champagne and a plate of four delicious chocolate desserts. Room service was prompt, and when we requested extra pillows, they were there in under - minutes. The bartender downstairs was great, and check-in and check out were efficient.
So the bottom line- I would not recommend this hotel for tourists because of the location, though if you get a good rate, I would go for it. Also, in warmer months, it really wouldnt be that bad to walk places. We paid --- for the room which included in room breakfast and a -pm checkout. The Starwood website often includes great rates, especially last minute, but it helps to know how to navigate it. However, there have regularly been affordable rates, even as low as ---. Either of these is a steal for Boston. I would strongly recommend this hotel for locals looking for a getaway, others looking for a more quiet location, and certainly for conventioners. It wasn't quite perfect b-c of the breakfast, and the bathroom could have been a bit larger. Nonetheless, this is a great Westin property.",Edge,Mobile,happy

id11220,"We stayed here on a friday night in one of the executive king rooms for a romantic getaway. The room had a couch and a big bathtub for two. Room was very nice. Flat screen was good. Bed was firm. You can tell this is a new hotel. The restaurant is also very good for food, but even more for martinis and some appetizers in the bar on a friday night, though it can be crowded. BEWARE Dupont is a very gay friendly neighborhood. Stopping in at the Fireplace Bar around the corner is not for everyone! 
The bad side is the heating system was messed up. The engineer came twice but really couldnt make cool air come out. We actually had to open the door for a bit to get cool air from teh hallway into the room. But sleeping was not uncomfortable. 
Room service was also a mess. They showed up an hour late, and had to make multiple trips because they kept forgetting things. Check your food before the waiter leaves!
After waiting for breakfast until about --:--, the front desk said they could not extend check-out past -pm.

id11231,"We stayed at this hotel during a very busy weekend. The hotel hosted the Green Bay Packers, tons of very devoted fans, and held two Marine Anniversary Balls. The staff did a very good job accomodating sooo many people and keeping the lines short. We received a notice telling us it was going to be very busy and what to do to speed the check out process up, etc. 
Suprisingly, some of the Concierge help was only OK. Better than other hotels, but not as good as some other Hiltons or other better hotels. Although, they were very polite, they didn't offer information. Since we had never been to San Diego, we could have used more help. For instance, when I asked for a map, I was given one which seemed fine. I only realized later it was a only a portion of the area. When I went back the next day, and pointed to other maps and asked """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""what's that of?"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""", I then received a color map with restaurants-landmarks highlighted and - other black and white maps.

The hotel is right next to the Convention Center but on the far side. It was about a --- minute walk to the Gaslight District and less to Petco Baseball Park. Some hotels are right in the District, which means tons of restaurants, a cup of coffee, a drink are all at your doostep. Prrobably no water view though. I would check out the Hyatt if we went again....it would be on the water and right across from District. I would also consider Hilton in the Gaslight District.

id11240,"After reading various negative reviews of The New Yorker, I was very tempted to cancel the hotel, and search for another one, I was pleased that I didn't. The taxi fare to the hotel from JFK is a fixed rate of $-- plus approx $- for the toll. Check in was quick and straight forward...staff weren't very smiley, but I wasn't planning to hang around for a chat. Security at the hotel is great, guests need to show their room key to get past. I was allocated a room on the --nd floor, there are plenty of lifts. The room was a double-double, side view, a double-double room does make the room appear a bit smaller, but it's not too bad. The room was very clean, bathroom was clean, and more than enough towels are supplied. The hairdrier is quite powerful, there is only one negative thing I can think of, and that is that the shower isn't powerful, but again it's bearable. Shampoo and Body Gel bottles are supplied and replaced if necessary.
Location: the location of the hotel is fantastic...minutes walk to Macys, and The Empire State Building, come out of the hotel, turn right and than left at the traffic lights...walk for a couple of mins and you're at Macy's. 
Tick Tock Dinner is to the right of the hotel as you're walking out, nice place, we had a $- tip added on at the end of the bill. Another great restaurant for breakfast, lunch and dinner is The Stage Door, again to the right of the hotel, cross the road. Great menu and reasonable prices, good service.
I would also recommend a cafe on --- Eighth Avenue, cheap, and the food is very fresh and prepared in front of you. Come out of the hotel, cross the road, turn left and walk for about --- mins.
The hotel does not charge to the room. 
The hotel bar is pricey!!!!!!!! But does play good --'s music.
Check out - it might be worth checking with the company you've booked the hotel with to see if the price you're paying includes local taxes. Our final bill had a total of --% added per night on top of our bill. If you have time to kill before your flight, you can leave your luggage with the hotel for a charge of --c per case-bag, and the same charge when collecting your case-bag.

The pool was large and the kids loved it. My husband was thrilled with the fact that an affordable motel had a fitness center. I spent a majority of time on the computer in the complimentary business center, set up in the lobby. I was able to continue to book and plan the rest of our road trip through the use of their computer. There was no additional charge for printing off the web pages. This was helpful. I would only ask them to change two things. First, you access everything from the outside, so they should not refer to themselves as a hotel, but rather a motel. Second, they should offer at least some type of complimentary breakfast, cookies, or something. Most hotels do in Austin and if they took the time to clean up the physical facility and their image, since it switched owners, it would be a final touch. Further more, I feel their extras at the price offered, put them above the other motels in their class. This should be incentive enough for budgeted travelers looking for a little more for their money. They should not trick the public by saying things like, """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""hotel"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". That only sets some travelers up for disappointment. The same theory goes along with the breakfast, you offer so much in extras, that the first time traveler would expect """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""something"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" in the way of food hospitality.

Walking distance to times square, madison av and -th av, but not on a super busy street itself which is nice. Recently redecorated by Marriott and now marketed as an Autograph Collection hotel. Its certainly no ordinary Marriott hotel, this is boutique style, good small cozy restaurant, trendy and cool bar and very personal well decorated rooms with a very engaging service.
General standard of the hotel - very good to excellent
Standard of the rooms - excellent (although quite small rooms)

Parking can be done in the parking structure across the hotel for $ -- a night when there is a game on and less if there is no game. However it does not allow you to get your car in and out.

Do that online when you book the hotel, quote the number upon check in and enjoy complimentary fresh hot and cold beverage in the morning + a paper.

One day we ordered some snacks in the evening, and room service brought them to us on a table in the room so we felt special. We had a few desserts from Morsels we had bought downstairs. Internet signal was weak and an Ethernet bridge was provided, I ended up using my data card I have which was faster. We ate at Robert's in the hotel once for dinner and it was very good. Staff and service was excellent from the bellmen, check-in-front desk, concierge, maid, room service, and engineers. Staff responded promptly to concerns or questions when contacted. The hotel lobby is grand, the roses changed several times during the week, and the lobby floor shines immaculately – definitely impressive! Our room was very clean. The bath rug was removed and missing a few days, so we asked for another one. We spilled coffee one day on the carpet by the bed and the next day asked housekeeping to clean, which they did while we were gone during the day and you could never tell it was stained or even damp. We were favorably impressed by staff at this hotel, and believed it was four diamond quality. It cost us $-- plus tip to get to the hotel via cab from National airport (you have to get in line to obtain a cab which can be confusing), and $-- plus tip back from the Omni through Abe's sedan and shuttle service the concierge booked for my husband and I with luggage. We were aware of the loud air conditioner and heavy noisy doors from prior Trip Advisor reviews so that was no surprise. We experienced slow elevators once during our two week trip. Many times during our stay the hotel was extra busy with different conventions going on. Everything was still handled quickly which impressed us, despite the number of guests we saw in the lobby and hallways. We loved the hotel and if returning to Washington, DC area would definitely stay here again at the Omni Shoreham. We heard some stories from other people we met during our trip about other places they stayed which were more expensive and poor quality in comparison. 
The metro is close by and convenient to the Omni. We purchased Smart Trip cards ($- each) at Metro Central (about three stops from Woodley Park so it costs $-.-- to get there) and I put on $-- for my card and $-- for my husband's card (he is a senior so his fare rates were half price). We still had some money left on the cards after two weeks. You can go to the website metroopensdoors.com to get directions from Woodley Park to wherever you want to go which is convenient. The Smart Trip cards also get you on some local area buses, including the DC Circulator that we used to get to Georgetown. 
We did the Grayline Double Decker (hop on and hop off) tour bus that stops across the street from the hotel – you have two days to use your ticket and we LOVED this bus tour! Excellent and highly recommend it. We liked it so much we did a six-hour tour on another day with Grayline to go see Mt. Vernon (go to Union Station before - AM to buy your ticket and board). 
Our first 'tour' vendor we had tried on our second night was through Royal Trolley to see the monuments in the moonlight - it was a big disappointment as not enough folks to run the trolley so they put six of us in a van; another couple who had done this type of tour in the past with other vendors said it was 'okay' but not great like they had experienced before. I would recommend using another vendor if you want to see the monuments at night – and consider one with a guide that stays with you to explain things as we sometimes did not know where to go after stopping to get out as this was our first time in Washington, DC. 
Places we would not recommend or go back to eat in the neighborhood: We tried the Lebanese Taverna on Connecticut one night, but were disappointed except for the few lamb kabob pieces and bread that were good – neither my husband or I would recommend going there and it was around $---person. We tried the Café Paridiso on Connecticut Ave. the first evening we arrived that others had mentioned on TripAdvisor but were disappointed and would not return. 
Favorite places to eat in the neighborhood close to the hotel - Open City Café across on Calvert Street. Petits Plats around the block on Connecticut Ave. is excellent – we ate there our last night; order the 'floating island' for dessert. Petits Plats also has rotisserie chicken you can order for take out too we found out. We ordered Chinese take-out once (lunch specials and soup) from the Eddie Cafe across on Calvert (but address says Connecticut Ave) and were favorably impressed and recommend. Chipolte's is on Calvert across the street too - good Mexican food and guacamole-chips for a reasonable price - we ate there several times. We had McDonald's a time or two that is on Connecticut just to keep our meal budget in line and they were surprisingly good too (they are downstairs which is different and we would take our meal or hot fudge sundaes back to the hotel). The CVS pharmacy on Connecticut has cookies, chips, sodas and water and is convenient about a block or so away from the hotel. We bought items and sundries quite a few times at CVS which is conveniently located. A dry cleaner is next door but we brought enough clothes for our entire trip; if you were there on business it might be handy to know it is nearby, however. 
There is a place in DuPont circle that says they have the 'best' cupcakes in a window when you walk by and you go downstairs – we bought four and the red velvet one was terrific with cream cheese frosting! If you spot this little bakery shop for cupcakes, be sure to stop! It is not far from the Grayline Hop-on, hop-off Double Decker tour bus stop in DuPont Circle. 
Our favorite place to eat in Washington DC that we highly recommend (worth the trip) is the Old Ebbitt Grill (a historic landmark since ----) at --- --th St. near the White House in Washington – we were there for lunch twice and breakfast once – excellent food, good prices, and amazing atmosphere whether inside or in the patio area. We also ate at Fago de Chao at ---- Pennsylvania Ave. (near the Old Post Office Tower); it is a Brazilian steakhouse that is pricey but great service and good food – a treat but will run you $---person plus tax and tip. We ate once at McCormick & Schmidt on F Street in Washington which was very good. We ate lunch once at Ella's Wood Fired Pizza which was good. The Chart House in Alexandria was enjoyable with great food. We also liked the buffet at the Garden Café in the National Gallery of Art at -th and Constitution N.W. which filled us up for the afternoon activities. 
One of the best maps we used was 'Washington: The Nation's Capital' that you can obtain from the Park Service at the White House Visitor's Center. We took several with us, had some others, but wore this map ragged until it fell apart as it became our favorite to get around, and we went back to get more. 
The International Spy Museum is great and worth the price to visit. Be sure to see the FD Roosevelt memorial too on the tidal basin (between the Jefferson and Lincoln memorials). If you want some good bargains, ladies will enjoy Filene's Basement to shop. We explored Alexandria, and Georgetown (check out the canals there in Georgetown) as well as Washington, DC. We even visited the zoo which is free the first day we were there and got to see the Orangutans go across the 'O line' which was amazing. Check with your representative a few months ahead of time to book a White House tour, the Library of Congress (amazing), and the Bureau of Engraving. The Omni Shoreham is a quality hotel to experience, and an excellent base to explore Washington, DC and the surrounding area. A wonderful and memorable trip for us – the fall leaves made it even more spectacular!",InternetExplorer,Tablet,happy

The service was top notch at check-in and they were very accommodating when we had to check out early because of the weather. The hotel was also very welcoming to kids, with complimentary warm milk brought up at night and our sofa bed made daily. 
The only downsides, and they are minor, is that there is no free wifi, which drives me crazy, and the bathroom was not very private.

The reason I'm writing this review is to share with everyone the fantastic and honest staff of the Sheraton Dallas Hotel by the Galleria. I specifically would like to highlight Mahom. I accidentally left my beloved David Yurman ring (a college graduation present from my parents) on the sink in the lobby bathroom. I then left the hotel and got in a cab to the airport. Mahom found my ring in the bathroom and instead of keeping it she kindly, honestly and thoughtfully set it aside in the hotel office for someone to claim. As I was pulling in at the airport I realized I didn't have the ring and called the hotel. Mahom answered and told me she had found it and it was there waiting for me. The cab driver turned around and took me back to retrieve it. I cannot thank Mahom enough for reunited me with this very sentimental and valuable piece of jewelry. I would have been heartbroken to have lost it and I cannot thank Mahom enough.

I heard some weird fact that every US President from FDR that has visited SF has always stayed in the Fairmont. I can certainly see why. The lobby is not trendy, or sexy, but it is grand and full of the finest marble. There must be -- different little couch areas to just to sit with a drink or wait for someone. 
Please promise me you will visit the in-house TONGA ROOM bar and restaurant, at least for a drink. It's quite a scene! Great place to have a Mai Tai before you head out.

Do like I did and sign up for the President's Club for free, before you check inn. It will get you free internet, gym usage, and a daily paper. You can do it at the Fairmont website.

id11353,"Several weeks ago, I attended a luncheon at the beautiful Conrad Hotel in downtown Indianapolis. Upon arrival, we found an exquisitely decorated table. And, of course, as an etiquette consultant you know what I looked at next…the table setting!
If the table setting is set correctly, guests should be able to look at it and immediately know which courses will be served. As expected, the Conrad Hotel gave us a perfect table setting.
What was most impressive was the manner in which guests were served. First and foremost, the wait staff was professionally dressed. Their uniforms were well-maintained and the servers themselves looked put-together. Here lately, at four and five star restaurants, I've observed way too many servers that look like they just rolled out of bed! Kudos to the Conrad Hotel for knowing the appearance of its wait staff plays a critical role in how it is perceived by guests!
One by one, guests were treated to a beautifully choreographed presentation of the meal. In unison, five to six servers emerged from the kitchen doors and, in single file, walked swiftly into the dining hall with plates in each hand. With excellent posture and pride in their step, they circled their designated table and stood at attention with all eyes on their lead server. After a brief pause, the lead server gently nodded his head at which time each server placed one of their plates in front of a guest. Returning to attention, all eyes were again on their lead server as they waited for his nod to serve their second guest. When finished, again in single file with pride in their step, they quietly returned to the kitchen. BRAVO! Applause! Applause!
Even better…the hotel's wait staff served from the left and removed plates from the right which is the correct way to serve a meal. A true class act!
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the most efficient way to serve a large number of guests. I am always disappointed when four or five star restaurants use the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""large tray of meals"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" method to serve multiple tables. There are two things wrong with this. First, it is not efficient. Each guest is served one-by-one by a single server who inevitably runs out of meals before the entire table is served. As a result, the server must return to the kitchen while the guests who HAVE been served must sit and wait while watching their meal cool*. This approach can take anywhere between two and ten minutes to serve a single table of eight to ten guests!
*It is bad form to begin eating before everyone at your table is served.
Secondly, the clinking and clanking of plates along with ten to twenty servers scurrying in and out of the kitchen and throughout the dining hall is loud and distracting. 
Overall this dining experience at the Conrad Hotel was one of the best I've had in a long time in the Indianapolis area. I am thrilled to have the opportunity to say, """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Congratulations Conrad Hotel. You are truly a class act!""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
One last note…I absolutely LOVE that the Capital Grille – a restaurant affiliated with the Conrad Hotel in downtown Indianapolis – immediately selects a color of napkin for its guests based on the color of their slacks or skirt. This ensures that noticeable lint will not be left on the guest. More sophisticated restaurants will always have white and black napkins available. Never hesitate to ask for a color that is similar to the color you are wearing. Unless, of course, you are dining at the Capital Grille where the maître d' takes the initiative to do that for you!
If we choose to spend our hard earned dollars at a four or five star restaurant, we should most certainly expect to be treated to the finer details that make it a truly pleasurable experience. I am thrilled to say the Conrad Hotel and Capital Grille know how to do just that.
Warmest regards,

-Some free extras, eg. free daily paper (USA today), mouthwash, etc.
Cons:

-As with most upscale hotels, all additional services are insanely expensive, from the mini bar to internet access from the business center. ($-.-- for the bottle of water in the room!)

-Only two chairs in room including desk chair.

id11384,"It's obvious that no expense was spared when building this property. The architecture and surroundings are beautiful, and it's a good choice for a golf or romantic getaway. 
Here's the good and the bad from my point of view:
The Good:
Rooms are beautiful and spacious, with all the - star appointments. Bathrooms really are stunning with big tub and a wonderful shower, great bath amenities. 
The landscaping and golf course are lovely. Take a walk around the resort, and check out all the amazing architectural details. There is a chapel in the hotel that looks like it is hundreds of years old. Amazing.
Pools looked great.
Cocktails in the lobby bar were excellent. The pomegranite mojito and the spicy margarita were delicious!
The Bad:
I reserved the lowest priced room, and when I phoned, asked for a room with a good view. I was told all rooms have a good view. After seeing the website pictures, I was a little disappointed when I saw how small our balcony actually was, with no privacy and too small for any seating, and our room was on a -nd floor interior courtyard, which had beautiful landscaping, but no real view.
Our room was a real hike from the lobby and we got lost a couple of times on the way to our room. Signage directing to your room could be better. And I'm used to huge Vegas hotels and have never had a problem...!
Dinner at Amara (sp?), the in house restaurant, was a real disappointment. Food was barely average ... do not order the Ahi! Mine looked like a preformed frozen patty, and was mushy and tasteless. My husband's steak was no better than something I'd buy at the grocery store. Service was good, but the food needs improvement.
Lighting in bathroom was way too dim. Who knows what I looked like after I put my makeup on?
No coffeemaker in room. I know - star places want you to order room service, but it would be so nice to have a little coffeemaker in the room!
Rooms were not completely soundproof. Someone had a long chat on her cell phone out in the hall at about - am, and it felt like we heard every word.
I'd visit this hotel again, but next time, I'd opt for a fairway view room to guarantee a great view, or ask for a first floor room, which have comfy big chairs on a nice little patio. And I'd skip dinner at Amara. Make reservations in advance for Addison; it was booked up when we were there.
All in all, though, a very nice place.",Firefox,Mobile,happy

The only disappointing thing was that we had to go back to our own bathroom when we came back!! 
The location was excellent too, right by Time Square but with the advantage of excellent soundproofing in the hotel. We didn't eat in the hotel choosing to eat out for breakfast, lunch and dinner. However, we did go to the bar for a drink one evening and what a beautifully designed place it was.

There is a complete kitchen for guest use in addition to full breakfast fare - waffles, fruit, toast, numerous cereals, pastries, juice, milk etc. Each room has it's own microwave, refrigerator, hair dryer, coffee pot and the ice machine has Sonic type ice.

Even though we arrived late at night and the hotel was overbooked, our room was available. We were upgraded to an extended stay suite which has a full kitchen. Staff doing double-duty at night so we waited a bit before being checked in. Interesting bit of history that the hotel was the first Embassy Suites in the country before being converted to a Holiday Inn & Suites. Access from parking lots are through locked gates into a nicely landscaped courtyard. Hallways to suites are exterior facing courtyard.
It was great to have a full kitchen as we like to prepare our own breakfast, lunch and snacks for the road. Grocery store was within driving distance of the hotel. Microwave was the strongest I've ever experienced and stove top is a nice electric glass surface. Dishwasher included but we just used it as a drying rack.
Bathroom layout slightly odd as the sink sits in the hallway connecting the bedroom with the living room. Nice to have a closed door between living room and bedroom so one can continue to work while other person sleeps. Bedroom window faces a roof (not sure how this is laid out) on which all the HVAC equipment sits and makes noise. Not too much noise, but ugly enough that you won't be looking out the window anytime soon. However, climate control worked perfectly -- air not too dry and not too humid; quite operation.

The large bathroom had a stall shower and triangular spa tub. We had interesting views west down at the tracks and north towards the river if you stood by the window.
With Hilton Gold we received two $-- vouchers for each night of our stay - redeemable for breakfast at State & Lake. We enjoyed red velvet pancakes, egg white wrap, sausage egg and cheese casserole, short rib and spinach omelet, etc. Skip the biscuits and gravy if they are on the menu.
Although we dis not partake of the rooftop lounge, we did take a tour and it is spectacular. Even on Saturday night we did not hear any noise leakage and we were just two floors below it..Guests get priority past the velvet ropes.
A few caveats:
The hotel has limited drop-off space - essentially a slight widening of State Street. On Saturday night this can fill up with stretch limos although most times the valets did a good job of keeping things moving.
The gym is small - there are about six treadmills, five elliptical trainers, a couple of recumbent bikes, and some dumbbells. No weight machines.
I thought that the Gilchrist and Soames amenities were a bit lackluster for this level of hotel. No bathrobe provided.
The back to back flat screens cause remote issues, turn one off and the other goes on.

The Lobby is extremely elegant, with ample seating so that guests can use the complimentary wifi for -- minutes at a time. By New York standards the room was big! It’s fair to say that the bathrooms are quite small but it had everything you need and can easily accommodate - at a time. Okay the TVs aren’t plasmas but does that really matter? The bed was unbelievably comfortable and despite being in the middle of Manhattan you could hardly hear the noise outside.
If security and safety is an issue for you, in what can be a dangerous city, you needn’t worry at the barclay. We stayed for - nights and every time we went to the hotel there was at least - police officer standing outside the hotel and usually two. They weren’t dealing with trouble, just standing chatting to people passing. A final point is that diplomats of the UN stay at the hotel and the US department of treasury had a meeting there while we were there so it must be safe!
As everyone else has commented on the location is amazing, a couple of minutes walk to Grand Central, which is a very well connected subway station. There are also very good restaurants nearby, recommended to us was Appertivos which is - block away, an Italian with great pizzas! Also a bit further away is Hillstone which is just incredible, also recommended by the concierge.
My only criticism of the hotel is the price of the food and drinks in the hotel. I understand its a hotel in the middle of Manhattan but $-- for a omelette, really? To avoid this we went to grand central cafe in West Hemsley Walk, which is where the locals went for their breakfast and is much more reasonably pried. 
The standard of service throughout the hotel is exemplary, everybody was friendly, any minor issue we had such as loosing door cards was quickly dealt with minus fuss. The gift shop in the hotel was well stocked with suitable opening times, and had everything you might need such as medicine.

Plus:
-. The renovated room and the corridor look very good. I like the blue sky (or sea?) design and the new layout of the room - it makes me feel at home. There are also enough lightings to make the room as bright as possible.
-. The Staff is very friendly - no matter it is for check-in, check-out, and operator-guest services.
-. The fitness center is also excellent with up-to-date cardio equipment, though there are that many weighting equipment.
-. I like the design of the lobby lounge. It's a great place to get-together with friends.
Negative:
-. The internet speed is unstable. It is very good for my - first days but it starts fluctuating a lot (and even sometimes disconnected) for the last - days of visit. I did call the operator (and the service provider) to help but nothing is improved. Surprisingly, I found the Internet speed at the lobby (which is a free Wi-Fi service at the lobby) is much better.

id11485,"My husband was booked to work for a week in NYC and was put up in the London NYC. The company graciously invited me to join him and I took advantage of the offer for two nights. The front desk staff was efficient and gracious, the doorman attentive, and every staff person we encountered greeted us. The housekeeping staff came several times daily to check if all was well and offered services, such as turning down the bed or to inquire whether we needed anything. 
The room we were given had two beds, which we had requested, due to my light and restless sleeping tendencies (request made in advance but not guaranteed), and was a two room suite, which, having booked at the bottom of the rate range, must be the case for all rooms. The rooms were spacious, although not large by most standards, but very pleasant, owing mostly to the efficient design of the furnishings. The two flat screen TVs, motorized drape controls, very responsive climate control system made the accommodations very comfortable. The bathroom had two lighting systems; one stronger one for grooming and makeup and the other on a dimmer to allow for subtle lighting during sleeping hours. The shower was actually two showers in one long area, with separate controls. The door to the bath was a pocket-type door on a sliding track. Great space saver. Very clever. Slippers and robes were provided. Ten real take-them-off-the-bar hangers with skirt-kpants clips. Iron and ironing board in the room. Hairdryer also. Nice soaps and decent shampoos and conditioners (although, pity, they were not Molton Brown, my very fav.) 
As my husband is required to travel a good bit, and I accompany a good part of the time, I consider myself a veteran traveler. I have a standard bag which includes a goosedown pillow, a white noise machine, sleeping mask, and bamboo blanket. In my experience, hotel pillows are uncomfortable, hotel rooms are generally not quiet (due to loudly closing doors, outside noise, etc), draperies do not really close out light and it is impossible to achieve a comfortable room temperature. I was so pleasantly surprised to find that the pillows at London were identical to my own, the draperies closed impeccably and blacked out all daylight, and the room doors did not slam and clatter when closed. In all honestly, I must mention that there did seem to be endless construction noises going on outside the hotel, even in the wee hours of the morning, but I cannot fault the hotel for that. 
In perusing other reviewers' comments before arriving at the London, I was somewhat apprehensive. Several comments were made regarding the front desk staff. My experience in dealing with the front desk staff over four days' time is that they never failed to be friendly, efficient and helpful. I never once had to wait to gain their attention. Never did anyone fail to acknowledge my presence in a moment. I cannot imagine more attentive or friendly service. 
I enjoyed the breakfast offerings twice during my stay, once having eggs and bacon and once having the cold buffet. Both times the service was impeccable, the food perfectly presented and tasty. 
It would be hard for me to imagine what else anyone could want to provide a five star experience. I would be happy to return to the London any chance I get. 
As I commuted from NJ and thus, took four train rides, I required transportation to the train station. The first time I requested a taxi, I was supplied with the hotel courtesy car, which took me to the station. Lovely fellow, the driver. 
Had the pleasure to dine in the Formal Dining room of the hotel restaurant. What a divine treat! Cannot do justice to describe the meal.

id11503,"I decided to go to Dallas on a whim for the weekend just to see the city. I used priceline to get a hotel downtown and got placed at the Sheraton for a really good rate. After reading the other reviews I was a little concerned about the hotel. 
Maybe it was because there didn't seem to be a convention going on the weekend of my stay, but my experience at the Sheraton Dallas could not have been more pleasant. 
I pulled up to the front but wanted to self park so the valet politely gave me directions to the parking garage. I then went to check in. No lines, and the man behind the counter had my reservation right away and handed me my keys within -- seconds. He told me where to go to get on the elevator and asked if I needed help with my bags. I got to my room and it was one of the newly renovated rooms. The room was not huge but perfect for my needs. It was amazingly clean, smelled great and had a large bathroom. They put me on the --th floor so I had an amazing view of the city.
To address some of the other complaints people on here had; I never once had to wait more then -- seconds for an elevator; the rooms were well appointed and clean; I never heard one peep from any of my neighbors, and I found the neighborhood around the hotel to be plenty safe (walked around the city all weekend including past - AM and never felt threatened). The hotel may not be located in the most exciting part of Dallas, but most of downtown is dead anyway...so that makes little difference.
I only have to complaints. The outdoor pool was closed, the indoor hot tub was also closed, and the indoor pool seemed to be open but was yellow in color and emitted an unpleasant odor. Also, one of the nights I wanted some late night food. I asked the concierge on duty if he knew of any places around that may still be open (it was -AM). He sneered at me like I was dumb for asking and said that there was a Denny's - miles away and that was all (I wanted something within walking distance). I ended up walking around and found my way over to Main St. where I found a number of open restaurants serving the after bar crowds. You would think in a hotel this size, the concierge would be more knowledgeable of the local area.
Overall I had a great experience, but like I said, there were no conventions going on during my stay. I could see there being some issues if the hotel was really busy. Needless to say,I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking at staying downtown and wants a good deal on a nice property.",Firefox,Desktop,happy
id11505,"Good:
Location across street from UN, near Grand Central.
Safe neighborhood.
Great views of Midtown or the East River.
Clean rooms.
Fairly quiet area at night--not much traffic and honking.
Close enough to walk to restaurants or take the M-- bus up -st Ave. to even more.
Bad:
No express checkout, and only two clerks in the mornings.
Huge windows and inadequate blinds let in too much light too early in the morning.
Thin walls.
Weak air conditioning in some rooms.
Old-school TV with annoying noisy channel-changer.
No mirror outside the bathroom.
Bathroom lightswitch is outside the bathroom--no late-night trips without waking your bedmate.
Towels not the fluffiest.
Section of window in front of couch actually slides open--beware if you have children, who could easily fall out.
Conclusion:
Clean, safe, adequate, and convenient--but don't expect luxury or attention to detail, and be prepared for some odd quirks. The hotel very much seems to have been designed for budget-conscious foreign diplomats.
The Millennium UN is an adequate hotel. I have no horror stories to tell. Yet there were a host of minor annoyances. First was when I tried to lower the massive shade covering the massive window; I merely pulled on it, and the whole contraption fell down. Maintenance had to reinstall it. Could've been a lawsuit, had it hit me on the head and had I been the lititgious sort. It could've really injured an elderly person.
I later saw that the smoke alarm was hanging open, sans battery. The maintenance man later replaced the battery and told me smokers often pull it out--despite the fact that the hotel has tons of smoking rooms. He said it's hard to enforce the no-smoking rule in the other rooms. Is it? Other hotels have a note threatening you with a cleaning fee if they detect smoking. Whatever--a nonworking smoke detector in a hotel full of chain-smoking Chinese diplomats is a bit worrisome.
Even more worrisome: the sliding panel in the huge window. The panel is right above the back of the couch. It's easily big enough for a child to crawl through and fall to his-her death. What were they thinking?
I had stayed in another room of this hotel a couple of weeks before, and its a-c unit was fine. But in this room, the a-c--even on full blast--was piddling. I had the maintenance guy come up; he made an admirable effort, but for naught. I wasn't sweating--and lowering the shade helped a lot during the day--but it wasn't the -- degrees I prefer in August.
I could hear the conversation of the people in the next room from the bathroom--and I could understand every word. Inside the room itself--near the window--I could hear talking, but not loudly.
Even the TV was a bit odd. It was an old convex-screen model, and the channel changer made this very annoying """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""thwack"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" sound with every channel change. I know that complaint may sound ridiculously picayune, but believe me--it got old fast.
And why is the bathroom lightswitch on the outside--like in Japan? If I make a trip early in the morning, I'd rather keep the light off till I have the door shut so I don't wake my wife. But with the switch on the outside, I can't do that.
If you stay here, give yourself extra time to check out, because there will be a crowd, and they only have two front-desk clerks.
The Millennium isn't a bad hotel--but it's not a great one. If you can get a good discount and you're prepared for the quirks, it's probably worth it. (Government rate is currently $----night.)",Chrome,Desktop,happy

id11542,"We booked this hotel on Priceline so we didn't know what hotel we were going to get - we just picked a few locations and a - star level. I was excited that we got it - I knew it would be easy to drop off our luggage once we landed and then go pick up our rental car. We were coming from Orlando where the Hyatt AND most rental car companies are in the one big terminal. It ended up not being as easy as Orlando - the rental car terminals are at a separate location. And there are two terminals - the McNamara (Delta) terminal and then the Smith-North (all other carriers) terminal. They are completely separate and there isn't a train or people mover connecting them. Instead you have to go outside and wait for a bus (not a long wait - maybe -- minutes) and drive over to the other terminal. If we would have known this I would have definitely booked a Delta flight since we could have walked right into the Westin. Then the Westin also has their own TSA security entrance into the McNamara terminal and four Delta kiosks right in the lobby to print your boarding passes.
Some rooms look into the middle open atrium area (ours did) and then others looked out over the runways. Our room was a little dark since we didn't really get any bright sunlight. The rooms were large and comfortable and very quiet. 
We used the valet for parking our car and it was about the same price as parking in the garage.
One nice perk of being a hotel guest - you can request security clearance to get into the terminal to shop and eat. You tell the front desk you want a pass and a police officer comes down to the hotel lobby to fill out your paperwork. We waited about -- minutes for this but the sign says it can be up to a -- minute wait. Then you can walk right in through security at the hotel's own security entrance. You do get pulled aside and they pat you down but they told us this was the case for non-boarding pass holders. It was actually a little weird to be in an airport terminal without a boarding pass! The Delta terminal is really, really nice. They have lots of restaurants and we decided to eat at Vino Volo. The food was excellent - we had a few small plates and two wine flights. The nice part of being through security (if you were flying out) is you can buy a bottle of wine to take to your destination. They also have small one serving bottles you could take to enjoy on the plane. We enjoyed watching all of the people and seeing a few run!
When we checked in they asked if we wanted to upgrade to the club level - it had breakfast and drinks and snacks at night. I think it was $- per person, per day. So it was definitely worth it! But the problem was we arrived on a Thursday and the club room isn't open Friday night through Monday morning. Since we were there Thursday-Sunday we only had Thursday night and Friday morning in the club room. They said they would only charge us for the days it was open. On our final bill we were charged $-- and I mentioned to them that we only were able to use it Thursday night and Friday morning - the equivalent to one night in the hotel. But since it was two days it was two charges. That was a little annoying but the nice guy at the desk did remove the -nd day charges for us. 
We had never been to Detroit before and the airport is a little outside of the city. We drove to Ann Arbor one day - something we might not have done if we stayed at a hotel in downtown Detroit.

Not a lot of space on the bathroom sink area though the bathroom itself was HUGE because they had assigned us to a handicapped accessible room! Talk about a weird shower!

It is intimate rather than overwhelming, very tasteful rather than over the top, and very easy to get around. Other hotels wow you with their scale; Palomar seduces you with their service. You would think this hotel has the potential to be snooty but it is not. For example, the wine reception in the lobby was welcoming and casual. I was treated like royalty but in a respectful and professional manner. 
Then there is Eloy. He was the concierge on duty when we arrived and was a great asset. He recommended an outstanding contemporary mexican restaurant (Komali) in our price range, made reservations, and arranged to have the courtesy car drop us off.

The front desk staff also provided helpful advice on things to see and do and were helpful in arranging other transportation during my stay. I stayed in a full water-view room on the -th floor (Room ---) and was very pleased with the room and the view, which was of Elliot Bay and the north end of Pikes Place Market. The view was quite remarkable! The bed was comfortable.The -th floor deck was a relaxing and enjoyable way to start the day with a cup of coffee and a piece of fruit from the market below or end it with a glass of wine and good company. The Inn at the Market is right in the heart of the downtown area and extremely close to everything including restaurants, coffee houses, shopping, Pikes Place Market, access to the piers on Elliot Bay, and the many available tours. My wife and I enjoyed breakfast and a latte at Cafe Campagne, just below the hotel, several mornings during our trip. The room I had was quite spacious. However, it was not designed for individuals or families who intend to spend alot of time watching television as the foot of the bed was situated so that it was facing the sliding door toward the view of Elliot Bay. The television was positioned to the side of the bed. This was NOT a problem for my wife and I at all. The bathroom was also quite spacious, though I think it could have been designed more wisely to include a seperate shower space in addition to the bathtub, which was just average. (The water pressure was abover average though) Lastly, the odor from the restaurant vent below entered our room once during our four-night stay. It wasn't very pleasant, however, it dissapated quickly enough after I turned on the quiet fan in the bathroom, which I left running most of the remainder of my stay as a precaution.

The rooms were decorated in deep purple and bamboo green that """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""grows on you."""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" We had a king sized bed in two room styles. The first was a typical squared room with a bathtub. The second was an irregularly shaped room that seemed to have a bit more room and a walk-in shower with glass doors. There was a flat screen TV with abundant recharging station and computer integration components. We had the benefits of free wifi, I do not know if that was a Hilton Honors benefit or standard. The beds had the european style double sheet folded over a down comforter. There were abundant pillows and the bedding was cushioned with a firm underlay. Both rooms and beds were pleasant and comfortable.
The fitness center and pool were across the second floor lobby in a YMCA. We did not use it but saw people working out through windows above.
The minor negatives: Located just past the corner of College on Third St., the entrance is congested and confusing. The driver is required to turn right across an fast moving exit lane from underground highway. The drive is shared with the entrance to the parking garage. On the occasions of two checkins, the bellmen were inside and there was no reception to assist with removing suitcases, opening doors, bringing carts, etc.. My advice would be to enter the drive, make a right turn into the ramp on the far left, stop in the drive and go check in immediately. At some point, a cart or bellman might appear or you can request assistance. It concerned me to see numerous parties fetch carts or remove suitcases and then be offered assistance to their rooms after the hard work was done. If you choose self park, you save - dollars and you will need to walk a fair distance. When you return to the hotel, you will be on the second level and can take an elevator at the right-far end of this lobby, past the bar to go up to your room or down to the lobby. For a short stay, I would recommend valet parking. For a woman traveling alone, I would definitely recommend valet parking. it appeared that car service was readily available with several cars for hire in the drive at most times. 
Staying in the area:
For exiting the hotel to walk about downtown, we recommend taking the elevator to the second floor lobby and exiting into the courtyard on the right. (The main entrance has a narrow path and runs adjacent to a moderately steep highway ramp that ascends from underground. ) At the end of the courtyard, you will be on College Street. If you continue across -rd St. and down College, you will first see Panera Bread and a host of restaurants and services in small courtyards and indoor malls in the following five blocks. There was a CVS in a small shopping area two blocks from the hotel. I did not find that there was much shopping available in the vicinity of the hotel. Since we had a car, we were directed to a very nice upscale mall (Southpark Mall) -- minutes away.

The rooms in the Waldorf itself are lovely and beautifully maintained by a very large housekeeping staff, but the Towers suites each tell a story about the world political and entertainment figures who have visited or lived in each. It's great fun to have a full dressing room or fireplaced living room or perhaps even a large dining room and kitchen and know history -- or an interesting romance -- happened in the same place. While the regular part of the hotel may seem like another NYC tourist trap, the staff at the Towers works hard to make you feel your privacy and comfort are their goal.

We took a couple of granola bars for the road after having morning coffee and tea. You could have bagels, oatmeal, toast, fruit, etc. There is a coffee shop-bakery next door that has more if you want it. The Mexican restaurant across the street is excellent and not overpriced. It's a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""hoppin' place"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" on the weekends because of the bar attached and there was a line to get in.

Extending our stay was an easy - minute process. Every staff member was smiling and welcoming. One evening it stormed pretty hard and our umbrella was in our car. Without hesitation one of the valet guys quickly ran to our car to retrieve it. Great service all around. Our -rd floor queen room was kept spotless and well supplied. No noise, great ventilation, great water pressure in the shower, very comfortable. Fee wi-fi was very much appreciated (one minor complaint: wi-fi was spotty one morning while trying to connect. A call to the front desk and a system reboot solved the problem almost immediately). The location is perfect - within walking distance to everything downtown Indy has to offer: circle centre mall, restaurants, bars, monument circle, lucas oil stadium. Had a delicious dinner at Palomino's, famous corned beef at Shapiro's deli, great stuffed breadsticks and long islands at Kilroys. Heard some great live music at Tin Roof. Oktoberfest on the circle was pretty cool. Except for driving to visit friends and to visit some of the local breweries, we never needed our car. My one suggestion would be to supply rooms with a mini-fridge...to store left-overs :)

id11646,"The hotel is well maintained, the room my family and I stayed in (Penthouse B on the top floor, --th floor) is a nice room, although the view from the balcony (yes the penthouse rooms, PHA and PHB, have balconies) overlooks the backs of other tall buildings. I'm sure PHA balcony views are much nicer as they overlook the city streets.
The room was in great shape, furniture in great shape and the kitchen well equipped. We got into our room in the evening and discovered a hot room - radiator type heating with the valve on full output. So after figuring through it, was able to lower the temp.
Breakfast is so-so, only because me and my family weren't crazy with this cheesy sauce they put into their egg omelets. If they did away with the cheesy sauce and maybe served scrambled eggs, breakfast would have been more enjoyable. Also, the staff were kind of slow to replenishing the supplies. The eating area is small so we just took our food up to our room so no big deal.
The only major issue-problem I had with this hotel (being on the top floor) is a water pump that lives up there on the top floor in the walls to support water pressure for the building. The first night there I got no sleep as this water pump kept cycling on and off every ----- seconds and as it cycled it would make this huge loud banging (almost explosion) sound that would keep me awake. After speaking to the maintenance guy the next day (he was very helpful) he was able to work out a solution - the solution was to put this water pump in manual mode and thus keep running all night which then it would make a constant humming sound. But it worked, I was able to sleep through the humming and was happy for it. Since I've left the hotel, I did fill out a survey for Best Western and mentioned this as a bad experience for me, I heard back from the Hotel manager and he apologized and said something was wrong with their system as typically this pump is cycled off at nights and should not have been running at all. So if you stay there and happen to be in the top - floors, you may want to remind the front desk to cycle the pump off at night.
Oh and I feel it is important to note the hotel's internet connection (WiFi and wired)....IT WAS AWSOME. The WiFi connection I had in my room is super fast, just as fast as my home Cable internet connection. The best I've ever had staying at a hotel.",Edge,Mobile,happy

id11716,"I stayed at the Club Quarters hotel for - nights and it was a comfortable stay. It's a curious mix in terms of amenities, it offers some nice touches such as some phone chargers in the Club Room, but then lacks some features which you might otherwise expect (e.g. in room safes). It is situated in the centre of Boston, but is quiet, with most of the surrounding buildings being office blocks. It is very easily reached from the airport using the Blue line to State St Station. The reception area is compact, and check in can be done via the desk, but check in using the automated machines is encouraged. The staff were courteous, but there wasn't a description of the facilities on check in, however, all of these were made clear in the room itself. It is possible to store your bag after check out, but as they are stored on another floor, make sure you allow them ---- minutes to retrieve it. 
I booked a standard room and this was decently sized. The decor is dark and a bit dated, but was not visibly showing wear and tear. It is possible to control the temperature in the room with a thermostat. The room is good if you want to work as it has a well kitted out desk with a desk lamp, and cables to attach a laptop to the TV screen, alongside a comfortable chair. Additionally free wireless internet is provided, and they have a nifty service which allows you to send documents to the printer located in the lounge room on the ground floor. There is a coffee making machine (with a solitary tea bag too), but no fridge. Additionally, there isn't a safe in the room or ironing facilitates. The bed was fine, and whilst not uncomfortable, it is some way off the beds you get at some of the big chains. The bathroom had a decent shower unit with good pressure, although as others have mentioned, the walls are a bit thin, and it was possible to hear the plumbing in the adjacent rooms. The bathroom amenities included a full size hair dryer, soap, body lotion, shampoo and dental rinse. 
Breakfast and other dining is available in the adjacent pub-restaurant, and there is a Club lounge on the ground floor to relax with some complimentary services such as newspapers, complimentary coffee & tea from a Keurig K-Cup machine and water (in addition to the water machines on each floor - which I liked). There are also - PC terminals with a printer. There is no room service, but they do provide a call-in service with local restaurants for a modest fee.",Firefox,Mobile,happy

There is a city bus that stops right outside the hotel and it takes you to the main bus terminal where you can catch a bus or train to anywhere.

id11727,"We got a good deal for our - night stay at Fashion -- via Octopus Travel just after the hotel had opened earlier this year and we’d been keeping an eye on the reviews on TripAdvisor ever since. Since they were all so positive we were really looking forward to a great stay... and we weren’t disappointed! Right from the start everything went smoothly, with an efficient check-in and very friendly staff explaining how everything worked. Within -- minutes of our arrival we were settled in our room on the third floor with our cases and hooking up our laptop to the free Wi-Fi.
Our room was gorgeous and more spacious than other reviews had us believe. The décor was über-trendy, all black, white and silver with fashion-themed pictures on the walls. There was also a massive HD flatscreen TV on the wall, big and clear enough for me to watch without my glasses. We had a queen sized bed (so incredibly comfortable we wanted to bring it home) with a nightstand and wall-lamp on each side. There was also a long, black desk with a leather and chrome office chair, which was perfect for using our laptop and sorting out the spoils of our shopping trips. There was a slim closet at the far end of the room (beside the door) containing an easy (and free) to use safe, a mini ironing board and iron. As others have said there isn’t much room to hang up many of your clothes in there (there’s a rail maybe --” wide) but there are plenty of drawers in the desk and nightstands, so there is plenty of storage room if you don’t mind ironing or the odd crease. There was also no light in the closet, which was a little awkward as the light from the room didn’t really permeate that far in. Then of course there was the coffee-making station, which I really loved. We had to ask for extra creamer a few times but we just left a note requesting it with our tip for the person cleaning the room and there was never any problem. Last but not least there was the bathroom, which was lovely. I really liked the big shower especially; yes it’s true that it’s hard to turn it on without getting your arm wet but just angle the shower head into the corner first and it’s not so bad... besides you’re about to have a shower and get wet anyway so there’s no big deal, right? Also really liked the big, fluffy, white towels and the Gilchrist and Soames toiletries.
Within half an hour of checking in, we were heading back out on to the streets to check out the area. There are lots of little cafés and pizzerias in the area and if you’re after a quiet little restaurant for dinner, there are several within a - minute walk down -th Avenue. Some of the places in the area we would recommend are Austin’s Café (-th Ave between --th and --th Streets) for a cheap and cheerful breakfast, Malibu Diner (--rd Street just off -th Ave) any time of day (it’s open ----), Rosa’s Pizza (on the corner of --th Street and -th Ave) for a quick slice or Restivo Ristorante (on the corner of --nd Street and -th Ave) for a quiet, romantic dinner at a reasonable price. There’s also a Starbucks on -th Avenue near --th Street if, like me, you need your regular venti. You’re also very close to Penn Station and Madison Square Garden, and Times Square is only a ----- minute walk away. The closest subway stops are on -th Avenue at --th Street (the - line) and -th Avenue (also known as Ave of the Americas) at --rd Street (the F and M lines). The closest liquor store (which aren’t as easy to find as you’d think) is on --th Street near -th Ave but all the market-deli type shops nearby sell beer if that’s all you’re after. Whole Foods (on -th Ave at --th Street) is also worth a visit for a posher snack – their fruit salads are really good.
Back at the hotel itself, we couldn’t have asked for better service. Our room was always cleaned impeccably while we were out, we got the turn-down service (complete with chocolate and the next day’s weather forecast) if we were still out at around -pm and we were never disturbed when we had the Do Not Disturb sign on the door. When we were tired one night we asked if it would be ok to have takeout delivered to our room and they were more than happy for us to do that – they just rang up to the room when the delivery guy arrived and asked if it was ok to send him up. We ended up doing that three times during our stay and there was never a problem.
The only thing that slightly annoyed me about the hotel was the room key swiping system in the lifts – you can’t press the button for your floor until you’ve swiped your room key on a pad in the lift, which sounds fine but it was a bit fiddly in reality and the anticipated green light sometimes didn’t appear as quickly or easily as it should. It’s ok if there are only a few people in the lift and everyone gives each other time and space to do it, but it can be a bit difficult when there are a mass of people all squashing in together, all wanting different floors, and you only have a few seconds to swipe your card and press your button before you pass the lower floors. Still, it’s a minor gripe.
We also checked out the rooftop bar one night. You can only access it on the express elevator from the lobby (and once they’ve stamped your hand) but they’ll let you out at your floor on the way back down. It’s a little expensive but no more so than most of the bars in Manhattan and the view is wonderful, especially of the Empire State Building. Most of the rooftop bar is enclosed in glass and plastic, with fairylights and greenery decorating the space, but there is also a small open area if you want to get some fresh air. If you’re staying at the hotel I would highly recommending checking it out one night, if only for the view.
So in summary it’s an excellent hotel – very chic, modern and relaxed, with great staff, gorgeous rooms and in a great location. Couldn’t fault it. If we go back to Manhattan and we can get a good deal I would definitely stay there again, so I hope they don’t put their prices up too much! Thanks for a wonderful stay, Fashion --!",Edge,Tablet,happy

Given the location, at first we were a little worried about not being within walking distance of Union Square (or the cable cars-Muni), but hey - it's San Francisco. Everything's close. Market Street, Union Square, BART, and North Beach are all just a short distance on foot. You can catch the cable car at California Street...which is even closer.

The breakfast and dinner meals provided were just icing on the cake. We were very happy with this hotel and our team plans on going back next year for competition!!! You just cannot beat the amazing customer service we received here!! As for any negative reviews you may read, remember the posted warning signs in the parking lot advising all valueables not be left in car, etc. are a REQUIREMENT by the City of Dallas. This hotel is safe and I never felt alarmed. Further, it was February and had just finished snowing the weekend before we arrived - therefore, there is no expectation for any outdoor swimming pool to be available.

Although the TV screen kept turning itself on every so often duting the night. One of those touch screen ones, I suspect that I wasn't deactivating it properly. But then surely you don't have to read the users manual just to use the TV screen! Other small but strange thing - the minibar was locked and there was just no key to be found. not sure what tthat was all about. Breakfast very good - quality of products and plenty of them. Fresh omelets made to order too which is always welcome. Doormen and bellboys extremely helpful and couteous.

This hotel is in an ideal location on Post Street with Union Square, shops and cable cars in close proximity. It also has the benefit of a lovely Italian restaurant on the ground floor handy if you are jet lagged and-or exhausted after sightseeing and shopping - but you will need to book as Fino's is rightly very popular.

The bar is also the place to enjoy your complimentary glass of wine between -.-- and -.-- which is a very nice touch. My room was clean and comfortably furnished and the bed was lovely and comfortable too. The bathroom was laughably small which could be a problem for some - I just admired the ingenuity of getting a shower, loo and sink in the same sized footprint as the wardrobe.

We loved this hotel's location in Union Square and knew that we'd be getting good service and a nice, modern room when going with the W chain. In that sense, the hotel totally met our expectations. 
The Room (A-) 
Bed was truly """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""heavenly"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" as they like to call it. We requested the highest available floor and they put us directly below the Penthouse (nice that they were paying attention to my internet request). The view is pretty nice from up there. By NYC standards, this was an average to above-average sized room. Nice modern decor, clean, with a large flat-screen TV and DVD player. The bathroom door was a slider and you could hear everything from either side - that is probably the only con. Well, that and the price, which I thought was a little steep when you add $-- in taxes and parking charges, which I will get to... 
The Service (A+) 
They have a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Whatever, Whenever"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" motto and encourage you to request anything you might need. We took them up on this, as we had our wedding cake topper (- year anniversary), but no plates or utensils to eat it with. We called down (and were greeted by name), and - no joke - in less than - minutes they were there with everything we needed. The concierge was very helpful during our stay as well. 
Added Fees (C-) 
They charge $-- a night for parking. This is valet service, but I asked if you bring your car to the garage yourself if it would be the same charge - it would. This is high for overnight parking, IMO, even for New York (where I have lived and parked overnight many times). As I mentioned earlier a $--- room is actually $--- with taxes. We did not order any, but I noticed that room service charges were a bit exorbitant and the one-hour massage costs $--- (I'm used to $-------, again I am talking avg NYC prices). So... with great service and style comes higher prices. I guess that should be no big surprise, but just wanted to paint a complete picture for you.

This relatively small hotel (----- rooms, I believe) was everything that my girlfriend and I hoped for. It is in a very convenient location (--- block from Union Square), and our room was clean, comfortable and well-appointed.
We arrived on a Saturday morning, having taken BART from the San Francisco Airport to the Powell Street station. This was about a --- block walk from the hotel, but as we had not packed too heavily, this was no problem. We got to the hotel around -- a.m., expecting to simply check our bags for a few hours until our room would be ready. Imagine our pleasure when the desk clerk informed me our room was already cleaned and available.
Our room was on the --th floor of this ---story hotel, which only has guest rooms on floors ----. I had read that rooms on the front of the hotel (Post St.) side tended to be too noisy, but we did not find this a problem. Yes, we did have a street musician down on the corner below us each evening, but they seemed to quit by ----- p.m., which was plenty early enough for us. Plus, they were all quite good!
We were blessed with wonderful San Francisco weather. Days were in the high --s and nights in the low --s. Really could not have asked for any better. I had done a lot of research ahead of time, so had a pretty good idea of where we wanted to go while we were there and how to get there, but the staff at the front desk were always very eager to answer any questions and help with any request I had. Very friendly and responsive.
Being a small hotel, they do not have on-site housekeeping or food service. The housekeeping was never an issue, as rooms were cleaned by the staff that comes in each day, and any needs we had after hours were quickly handled by the bell staff or desk staff. And, with so many fantastic restaurants in SF, we certainly didn't come there with the intention of eating room service meals. 
The hotel has an arrangement with a Cafe a few doors down for continental breakfast service. You get a voucher at the front desk and go down the street for tea or coffee, muffin or danish. We didn't expect much from this service, and we didn't get much, either. Not a very impressive selection or service at this Cafe.
The hotel's -nd and -rd floors house the Post St. Theatre, a quaint little theatre with not a bad seat in the house. We saw """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""The --th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee,"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" a play I was not familiar with ahead of time, but highly entertaining. Good music, great performances by the characters, and just a very fun, cute show. We got tickets the morning of the show at the TIX booth on Union square for less than $-- each. Well worth it, but hurry, it closes in early September. I would love to see another show in this theatre, and if you're staying in the hotel, you certainly can't beat the ease of the drive home after the show.
The hotel is in a great location. Having been to San Francisco a few times, I really enjoy staying around Union Square better than any other location. With the --day passports we got for public transportation, we could take any of the cable cars, streetcars, buses or subway trains for no additional cost. Best $-- I ever spent in SF, and we felt we could get anywhere we wanted to within the city by starting within steps of our hotel.

Pay the extra $-- for the stay+dine package. This gives you credit for the hotel restaurant. We ate breakfast there every day - great selection on the breakfast menu, all reasonably priced. The staff were so friendly, and the placemats were maps of San Francisco!
If you have a car, pay the pre-pay self park fee. The parking garage is less than a block away, and very easy to find. Don't waste money on valet parking when you don't need to!
Overall, we really liked this hotel. For central SF it is reasonably priced, and great value. Would definitely stay there again!",InternetExplorer,Desktop,happy
id11827,"My only complaint is that I never got to ask for anything - it was offered before I could think to ask. Clearly, staff training, from top to bottom, emphasizes pro-active customer service. Everyone I encountered was friendly, enthusiastic and helpful.",Internet Explorer,Mobile,happy
id11828,"My dad and I stayed here during our trip to the Stanley Cup (go Bruins!). I did a bunch of research before we came down and chose this hotel because it had a hot breakfast (just eggs the day we were there but good enough), free shuttle from the airport (which I understood would cost $-- each way!) and good location - close to downtown Boston.
Didn't know they also provided a shuttle to the T-line (Red line) subway, which would take you anywhere in Boston including the TD Garden, Fenway, Fenuil Market, Harbor etc. The shuttles ran like clockwork and were awesome. 
It's not a brand new hotel but it was clean, our room was very nice. I can't help but say it was an awesome trip and the shuttle service probably saved us in the order of $---US during our very short stay in Boston.
One thing I would mention on the negative is we went to have a celebratory drink after the Bruins won game -. My rum and my dad's double scotch cost....$--US! BYOB!
Great job Ramada folks!",Edge,Desktop,happy
